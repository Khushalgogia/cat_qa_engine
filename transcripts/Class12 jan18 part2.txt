 8G ratio, so sp law of equal ratios apply garoge, tu liksatya 5a-4b upon 5c-4b it has to be equal to k, and k k k is let see the options, a by b can be garoge, no 5a upon 4b can be garoge, no this is negative, minus 4b, this can be garoge 5 by 4c can be garoge, this a and c can be garoge this k has to be equal to a by c or b by d correct option is third option okay okay some other of proportions we talk about the first circular proportions the numbers when circular and let's say circular proportion what is the a by b has to be equal to b by c and this is equal to c by a if this is same, if this is same, proportion well let's say what is here this is a by c, which is the total it is c by a it is c by a, so a by b by c and it is equal to c by a so these numbers are in these numbers are in circular proportion so what you have to say here that a has to be equal to b, b has to be equal to c so if you have to keep the proportion in this way, if you have to keep the proportion that a by b by c is the same if this c by a is the same, then this is circular where you have come back which means that these three values has to be equal to and has to be same this is c by a so that is the circular proportion just for your knowledge, remember now tell me the correct answer to this question please now you can observe this is y plus 3 and here is x plus 2 is equal to 2 times y plus 3 upon 12 and it is equal to 12 upon 3 times of x plus 2. So you see, we have a circular proportions, a upon b must be equal to b by c is equal to c by a. So circular proportions is called a must be equal to b and it must be equal to c. That is 12. So if you have 12, then here x value will come to you and y value will come to you. So I have not applied any cross multiplies, so I have only applied the answer. So I have used a circular proportion to use a concept and removed x and y. So remember that this is the case when you have a circular proportion. Let us see. When common approach is to solving, there are two common approaches to solve questions. First is substitution and equating to a constant k. Substitution is useful when we do not have an idea on how to proceed. We substitute the values that satisfies the equation. What is the meaning of this equation? And we have to find the value of this expression. Let us see what will happen. This is the principle when we do not solve questions. First is substitution and equating to a constant k.
