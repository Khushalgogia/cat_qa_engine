 saksasif % change and % points basic fancy name saksasif % change when they are % multiple % changes or let's say if i say that this is a number i have 25% increase ok so tell me what will happen if i increased by 25% so what would it become 1.25A yes multiplying factor either it is 1.5 or 5 by 4 so it becomes 5 by 4A now i have increased by 20% more how much will it be now how much will it be multiplied 1 by 5 6 by 5 6 by 5 so it becomes this is 6 by 4 2A so this is a multiple % change first 25% increase now i say that this number is 50% 50% increase so what will it become 3 by 4A yes what will it be so it becomes 3 by 4 times so i can reach directly this is not a number if i use all these multiplying factors in one line how my number is first 25% increase what is the multiply factor 5 by 4 then 20% increase 6 by 5 then decrease of 50% means 1 by 2 so your final answer will be this gets cancelled this becomes 3 or 3 fourth of A but this is a successive percentage change you can also take these numbers as 1.25 in decimal this is 1.2 and it becomes sorry this is because it has decreased by so it is 0.5 you can multiply these terms also 1.25, 1.2, 1.5 but i think this is more comfortable in this situation so we get the answer as 3 fourth of A but this is a story it is a case of you because now we have 25% increase 20% increase if i give you a variable increase let's say if i am talking about P% decrease what will be the multiply factor 1 minus P is 100 yes 1 minus P is 100 yes how do you remember because you have less because you have less sorry any number and let's say you have to minus 100 so in terms of fraction 100% is 1 P% is P by 100 so how many? if there are successive changes in P% Q% R% in 3 stages the effective percentage changes 1 plus P by 100 1 plus Q by 100 1 plus P by 100 input pi plus Q by 100 input pi plus Q by 100 input pi plus R by 100 nvi number payab is to extend the process let's say if you can extend the process and successfully make a request if you can do a request if you can do a request اچھا یہاں پے آپ کو ایک جنرالیز ریزڈ اور بتاتے چلو سکسیسی پر سینٹے چینج نکارلنے کے لئے ایک فارملہ اور ہم لوگ ہوںز کرتے ہیں ایک فارملہ کو بس دیکھ لوگ یا گھر کرلو بہت اس کو نہ ایک تنگ دلسنے نہیں لگانے کیوں نہیں لگانے کیوں کہ یہاں ایک فارملہ جہاں ہمیںے ساں ایک למیژی تیری میں لگتے ہیں کبھی بھی بات ہوں گیOr cat , where you will test the exam where he will not be used So we have read it But let's see if its application can be done by application So if we can say A % or B % Yes A % is a % and B % If these are two % then final % or the successive % change would be A % plus B % plus A % upon 100 If there is 3 A, then first take final % and then whatever will come take final % with C This is the only thing to do The successive % change is A % plus B % plus A % upon 100 If there is a negative % change, let's say it is decreasing B is minus 20 % this is 25 % So what will you do? You have to write as a minus This is the only thing to remember about successive % change If it is clear then do something Tell me the correct answer The correct answer is A % We should have come today 90K So 1 lakh square feet was the arable area of a certain field At the end of year 1659 So 1659 and what was the area of this field? 1.0, Rupal 0 Yes, 100K Now 60 is 60 is 60 It has increased during the year 60 and 61 the arable area Increased by 10 % and decreased by 18.18 % respectively What is the arable area at the end of 1860? First of all, what do you want to do? 10% increase because in 1860 This land area of this field increased by 10 % Which means you multiply it by 11 by 10 That is 11 by 10 So it becomes 11 1.0 cancels and 4.0 will be added 1.0 Now what will happen next? It has decreased by 18.18 % Now decrease by 18.18 % It has increased by 9 to 2 to 9 9.0 to 9 So the fraction is 11 2 by 11 No, I will not say 9.0 to 9 18.18 will be 2 by 11 The decrease will be multiplied by 9 by 11 You have done 9 to the value of 11 So you have to multiply it by 11 11 will be cancelled by 11 You get 90,000 square feet At the end of 1661 How did you see this? What do you do directly? You multiply the number of cases You multiply the number of cases by 11 by 10 9 by 11 This means what is the final result? 10,10,10,10,9 Or you were going to tell the limitation If you use percentages in this way A plus B plus A plus A is 100 There is a problem in doing this Because if you look at the percentage of points You are not comfortable Because if you remember the percentage of the points The number of the fraction values Otherwise you will struggle This is the most safe approach Okay Let's move ahead The percentage of points is very clear Let's tell you two statements There is only one percentage in this statement There is only one percentage in this statement There is only one percentage in this statement A has increased By 2% What does this mean? A has increased by 2% If I say Let's say 1 is a person 1 second Let's say Here I am saying A is a person He has got 80% marks 80% marks Now I am saying here What does he do next year? Next year His marks increased By 10% In two situations It has increased by 10% And I am saying His marks increased by 10% points What does this mean? Both are different 80% marks And it has increased by 10% His value is 10% Which means It has become 11% So it has become 88% marks In the next year He has increased by 10% He has increased by 10% What does this mean? 80% You have to add points 10% Now he has got 90% In this year Percentage point And the unit for the matter Difference of two percentages It forms 8% of the total food gain production in year 1 And 12% of total food gain in year 2 Percentage increase So how many percentage increase From 8% to 12% Percentage increase If you talk about it, There is no value 8% to 12 So it has increased by 4 On a base of 8 That means 50% increase If I talk about it How many points have increased? So it has increased from 8 to 12% Which means there is an increase of 4%. That is the only percentage Here is the change of percentage points. This time I have to keep my mind Yes Tell me the answer. Population of a change Because of 200K In 2020 annual growth in the population 20% and 21% They have 10% In 2021 What is the population? 10% will increase by 10% Population is 200K in 2020 annual growth in the population 2021 may come 20% 1 by 5 6 by 5 20% 240 There is 10% In the annual growth in 2022 2021 What is the answer today?animation Througheee On also Queue On the ahead On the component� On the component And annual growth rate was 20% which means it will increase by 2021 and till then it will increase by 20% which means it will multiply by which of which? 6% so this will be how much? 20% like 40,000 at the end of 2021 now in 2022 annual growth rate was 10% point increase this will increase by 30% what is the meaning of 30%? 13 by 10 this is the multiplying factor it will multiply by 10, 10 gets cancelled it will be 0, 0, 0, 13, 4 is 50, 2, 5, 13, 2 is 26 and 5, 31 so 3 lakh, 12,000 is now the population at the end of 2022 now in 2023 what is it? 20, 23 what was the population in 2023 if its annual growth rate increased by 10% now this annual growth rate will increase by 10% okay 10% increase 10% increase what is the meaning of 10% increase? in previous year it was 30% it increased by 10% this time the growth rate is 23% it is 33% it increased by 33% so you have to tell us what is the meaning of 33% okay it is 30% after that 30% into 10% 30 into 10 into 10? if the annual growth rate increased by 10% then it will be able to increase by 10% if had it been the case that annual growth rate is 10% then you will tell us that 10% annual increase rate if its annual growth rate has increased by 10% which means the growth rate in previous year was 30% it has increased by 10% in this year 2023 it is 33% yes, it increased by 3% now see here many times I was going to come to this point how can I handle this? either I can do this into 1.33 I can do this into 1.33 or if it will be a 3.3 then how can I handle this? why 10% what is 23% what was the population in 2023? if its annual growth rate increased by 10% now this annual growth rate percentage point is not increasing okay 10% increase 10% increase what does it mean to increase by 30% in previous year it was 30% it means it has increased by 10% this time the growth rate in 2023 is 33% it has increased by 33% just tell us what does it mean by 33% okay, it can be done by 30% then it will be 30% by 10% 30% by 10% why by 10% it is 33% it is 33% yes it is 300 but for me it is a work of 30% it is a work of 30% so for that what else can I do for the second work? I need to take out percentage I will take out easy percentage I will do this in 33% I will say 30% and I will say 3% this value I will talk about this important point is how to handle the 10% which we have 10% in your city 1 lakh this was the population in your city now you have to tell me the 10% of this value if you have to tell me 10% of this value 10% is so much what do you do? just give it 10% whenever you have to tell me the 10% what is the meaning of this? you have to put decimal point here you have to give 1 0 10% cancels now I will say that it will be 40% so 10% now I will multiply it with 4% so what will be 40% 40,000 and this was the 1 lakh let us say if I say 3,7,8,9,4 this is the value if I tell you tell me the 45% value of it what will be the value of this value so I will tell you how to handle this thing you will have to break down the 10% what will happen? you know how much will be the value of 40% 3,7,8,9,4 this is 10% 4 times is 40% if you have to do this then you can add 10% 3,7,8,9,4 so this is 5% see now this becomes 16,1,7,3,5,3,1,3,15 15,15,15,7,6 plus this is 1,8,9,4,7 let us add these two correct you did not multiply it you did not multiply it let us say what will happen to 30% 10 into 3 would be double 0 this is 936 93600 is 30% and what will happen to 3% increase this value it is 912 or 10 1,29060 it adds this was 3,290 this is 1,290 so it becomes 4,49060 this is the final population after 2023 4,49060 correct so this is my idea how I handle the percentages either I can use decimal numbers I can use fractional numbers I can use this way I also break the percentage in multiples of 10 and so on yes 25 and 10 when Anil brought in additional capital is stake in the company increased from 40% to 50% so what is the difference in percentage increase and percentage point increase of his stake so what happened first? so it was a stake and now it has been a stake what is the difference in percentage increase? how much will it increase? 50-40 10% increase is over 40 what does it mean? 14 25 percentage point point increase what will happen? 50% or 40% what is this? so 25% and simply 10% but it is not confusing now let's move on to the next topic percent so what happened first? how much was his stake? 40% and now his stake is 50% now what is the difference in percentage increase? how much will the percentage increase? 50-40%, divide by part yes and then over 40% what does it mean? 14 means 25% so percentage point percentage point increase so what will happen? 50% or 40% what is this? 10% so 25% and simply 10% it is not confusing now let's move on to the next topic that is product constancy product constancy where they are they use the situation in the question they make a lot of questions in the situation about percentage what is the difference in the product constancy? let's say it is the smallest example so this is if you are talking how do you make a question like you are buying from 1000 what is the price of sugar? and the quantity you have bought? this will give me the total expenditure this will give me the total expenditure what I am saying? but the price of the unit and I bought it in quantity what will I tell you? how much the product will be purchased by the expenditure if I talk about area if you ask me whether it is the area of the square I will ask you let's say this product is known as the area of the rectangle correct? so this is also product constancy we will talk about how the relation of the product is that a cross b give me some quantity I have to handle the question where I give me a third quantity so what is the value of the product here? the general concept is let's say a has been increased a has been increased there is an increase in x and b has been increased y so you have to tell how much increase so let's say the value of the product is a b it has been increased so what is this? 1 plus x upon 100 and b is into 1 plus y upon 100 correct? now what is the value of the product here? c nu so what is the value of the product? a b into 1 plus x upon 100 so let's see c nu is my a b times 1 plus x upon 100 what is the value of the product here? you can say that the multiply factor of this change if i know the aim is if i know the multiplying factor and b then the change of the C is the multiplying factor of a then the multiplying factor of c but the product of b is into the multiplying factor is that clear? ایک چیز ہے ایک questions بنتے کیا سے ہیں Let's say I'm saying that I'm saying that I've lent of rectangle go 25% سے increase کر دیا ہے 25% سے increase کر دیا lent of rectangle go اس کی breadth go ki tine percentage سے decrease کر ہوں گa so that its area remains same. Its area kya rahe same rahe. So me اس کی breadth go ki tine percentage سے decrease go. 20 other type questions. So ek baan question nigh ba tahan nigh ba tahan just me re ba dhyang do baat pe. Ya kya rahe lent as increase by 25% now I have to tell that by what percentage should I decrease the breadth to get the area same. Sapsi pe le cheese aapko patai ki multi-pline factor juri change in lent hova. Uso ko multi-pline karo ge ya breth se. So you get the multi-pline factor of area. Yes. Aapla. multi-pline factor hova ta kya cheese hai. multi-pline factor hova ta kya cheese hai. Kya sa baan aapko hame sa. Kya sa baan aapko hame sa. If this is the let's say change multi-pline factor hova ta kya hame change likthe oap. Because multi-pline factor let's say 25% increase ova koi cheese. Aap na iska multi-pline factor aapke haapke baas. 5x4. Correct. 4 se increase kari bhi aapne hai aapne hais cheese ko. To jo multi-pline factor hai wo do cheese aate de te aapko. Kya. New value aapon previous value. Correct. Change milaake. New value aapon aapko de de te ka earlier value jovi te aapki. Uemavikayus. Sanjayi ga li use ka aga. Aap ga one Besanjayi anomaly. Aap kya e hai to哀 Yellow golden aap koHa街 تو multi-pline factor here if area or this product is C it has to be constant if this is given in this relation if it is to be constant area should be the same its multi-pline factor should be 1 that means you can take the multi-pline factor of B what will you do? length may be 25% increase what will you do? 5x4 breadth may change so that it should become this product should become 1 so what will you have multi-pline factor of breadth? 4x5 4x5 which means 1-1-20% decrease so you will have a idea that if you increase 25% then this offset will be 20% by decreasing you will also remember 20% increase will be 20% decrease so this is about product constant C remember if product is constant then what will be the multi-pline factor it will be made if you want to handle it on the other side check it out because we have already covered ratios and when we are talking about comparison when we are talking about multi-pline factors then ratios are not far behind let's say length, breadth and area what is the difference between length? new value and old value if I ask you 25% increase then this will be the new and old value of ratio values 5x4 5x4 4x5 is made by the next 5 what is the value of breadth? should be the same area remains the same so what will be the new and old ratio? 4x5 so 1 will be the ratio ratio should be the same correct now this ratio area is the final ratio because area is same in both these cases so the new and old ratio is the same correct if the length is the same then what will have to be the breadth? 4x2 so that it becomes 1 is 2 if the breadth is 4 is 2 then what is the meaning? how much change is there? earlier or 5 and it has become 4 there is a decrease of 1 over 5 units so 20% decrease correct so this is just a product constancy is this a distance speed between the time speed price into quantity expenditure I have already explained all these things yes, there is nothing else I mean, this is the third one yes whatever you have realized that is why I have analyzed A cross B should give me C anything following this relation can come right first we convert the percentage into fraction we do this replacing so whatever I have already explained where the product of two variables x and y is constant so what you have to do? right whatever your product is you have to make its multiplying factor you understand this and you will get all the answers you will get we always have multiple numbers number 7 9 9 8 9 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 20 20 20 20 22 20 20 8.5x6, 1-1x6, 1-6. 16.2, 16.6% decrease. 16.2% decrease. 20% increase. 25% increase. 20% increase. 25% increase. 20% increase. 20% increase. 16.66% 16.66% 16.66% 15.66% 15.66% 16.66% 16.66% 16.66% 16.66% 16.66% sh滶星itu efforts a family spends a fixed amount on rise every month. So, they could have a price of something, they would buy some quantity of it and they would have some expenditure on this rise. Let's say in month 1, they bought the price of x on the rise of the rise of y and their expenditure it becomes xy. Okay, this is the story. Now the price of rise increased to 2. Increased to 2. What does it mean? The price of rise increased to 6. That is, the price of x is 6. And it reduced the quantity by 8. Which means, now they are purchasing y minus 8. Correct? So, in the expenditure, the baby is the same. That is xy. What is in the month 3? When the price reduced to 4 kg. Now, the price of 4 kg is increased. They increased consumption by 12 kg. And what is now? Now, what is now? This expenditure was xy. If the total amount spent on rise remained the same throughout. What was it? We have to find a value of x. So, if we find 1 value, then we can find another value. Correct? Now, see, how to handle these two situations? Month 2, month 3. Here, you can see, you can divide these two by cjc. Divide these two by dhire. What will happen? This will be made by cancel. Multiply them by cross. Which means, 6y minus 8 into 648. Should be equal to 4y plus 48. Correct? This will be here. What will happen to 2y? 96. And what will happen to the y value? 48. If the y is 48, then in any equation, I can find the x value in y48. Let's say, I put this in m2. Here, the 6 into 48 minus 8 is? 40. 40. It has to be equal to x into y. Or, I have the same expenditure. How much is this? 240. The value of x value is not required. Y will be available to me. The expenditure will be there. Both of them will have the same product. So, what will happen to us? 2. The spend was 240. How to handle? You know, this relation is equal to 1 by c. Which means, X into y was my expenditure. Now, this price increased too. If this was something like this, that price has increased by... I mean, x price increased. Yes. That's why, I am solving it. 6 and q minus 8. And the second equation is, 4 into q plus 12. So, I was solving it by 6 or 16. Then, we have to substitute it there. In that case, it will come in that case. I was wondering about the negative. I will follow. Here, we have to remember this thing. 2 and b. Yes sir. The answer is 240. Now, percentages index. Let's talk about this. What is index? Let's say, scaling. Scaling. How to scale? Like, say, say, say, say, say, example, like a cat. Let's say, final criteria. I am in the way. What it says is, cat's score, cat's score, they will scale down to as 280. And your personal interview, they will do 20. So, what is this? 4 is to 1. And, total, your score will be 100. So, this is indexing. Correct. What is the story? Your cat's score didn't come in 80. Right? Here, you said, see, the score of the cat, what was the score? Let's say, it was 200 marks. Let me understand. You got 100 marks out of 200. Right? Now, it has scaled down to 80. If your 200 marks came in 100 marks, then, if this marks 280, now, understand. I have done what I have done. If you do 200 to 80, then, how much will this 100 be? That's the only thing. So, how much will this value come? How much will this value come? 100 to 200 to 80. Okay. Theoretical meaning, I don't remember. But, what is the sense of this? What I can explain to you. I have done what I have done. What is the meaning of index? I mean, cat's score, this was the maximum marks. You got 100 marks in the cat's score. Now, I have done the final criteria. I am going to say that 80. If you talk about the weightage, the weightage is giving 80 percent weightage to the cat's score and the weightage is giving 20 percent to the cat's score. Which means, the maximum marks of 200 were now 80. So, 80 marks, the first one that came in 100 marks, how much will it come in 80 marks? So, what is the comparison of what is the standard of 80 marks? So, how to get it out of 100 to 200 into 80. If you look at the theoretical form, then, this is the end. Index is the representation of the value of a group of items, relative to its base value is common indexes. We come across our inflation index and the stock indexes. A particular ear is decided as the base ear for an index. For this base ear, the index is assigned a value, typically 100. Where 100 is the index value in the base ear. Now, index value in ear acts, what will happen? It would be price of goods, your stock in ear acts and price of goods, stock in base ear into 100.

Nu N现在 bhai neighbourhood. ... ......, .......Nara Keik records சیم نکلے گا چینجی با Thiegai ایک کشن کرلو ایک دو اگتو اگتو اگتو اگتو اگتو اگتو دیکو ایجو لائمتین انا آست here a question percentage change in index value in the year will be same as the percentage change in price of items in that year A question is that index is there you have 127 132 what is the price of the index in the year? what was the price? now you don't understand the price of the index how much is the price of items in the year? this is the index you have 127 132 in index, you have to change the price of items in the year what was the price of items in the year? now you understand how much is the price of items in the year? how much is the price of items in the year? percentage change can be found in the index so, first of all, what will be the annual inflation rate? your 132 minus 127 divide by 127 it is 5 upon 127 into 100%. and how much will this be? 500 upon 127 if you do this, it would be 4. so, at 4, what is the price of items in the year? 3.9 something should be found you should divide it precisely, if you divide it, it will be 500 divided by 127 which is 3.93 this is the inflation rate annual inflation rate 5 year inflation rate is from 2000 to 2017 so, the base year inflation index was 100 and this is 32 so, how much will this be? difference is of 32 divide by 1. 5 year inflation rate in the year, how many entities have been created? so, you have to divide it in 17 and in the year, index was 100 so, it is a change of 32 over base 100 into 100 so, how much is 32? 32 percent the change is in inflation what is the price? 1 more question what is the price? 1 more question what is the price? 2 more questions 5.3 5.3 ok 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.2 5.3 5.3 175 175 Okay, so share price of a company X was 85 in 2010 if the company's price has always followed the nifty then what was the share price of X in 2018 if the 50s to that 50 100 and 10 500 in 2010 and 2018 respectively So, if the nifty has followed the nifty then the index should have been the same, theoretically you have to use it for me, but for me it is as much as 2010 and comparison is 2018 If the nifty had been 5100 in 2010 and the company's price was 85 in 2010 then how much share price will be there? So, if you scale up the 5100 then how much will the price be there? So, you have to find this value, this value would become 10,500 into 85 divided by 5100 So, you can change it from 575 to 575 So, it is something 18 by 17 So, you have to find the indexing approach of percentage changes So, you can change the percentage of Y as a percentage of X So, you can change the percentage of X and Y as a percentage of X is 25% So, you can increase the number of cases of X and Y as a percentage of X is 25% So, what do you do? What will be the percentage of X? 20% is 20% of X. So, what will you say? That A is 20% less than B, now if I increase it from X, then which one will I change based on? So, what I have done is, I have changed the percentage of X and Y as a percentage of X is 25% Now, if I am saying that A is 25% less than B, so I have changed this B. But what I have done here? Product consistency is kept here, how much is the consistency? How much is the increase from A to B? Is it able to tell the multiplying factor? 5x4 5x4. What is the multiplying factor for offset? 4x5 So, that this product should remain 1. And what was the product consistency we were reading? Yes, if I increase the amount of A in A, then how much will I decrease in B? If I want to remain the product, then I should have written the same as the two offset. If X is A by B more than Y, so many times more than Y, is it a percentage? Y is less than X, let's say Y is more than Y, so X is bigger than Y. X is bigger than Y, so X is bigger than Y. What is the meaning? X minus Y is given as A by B. Correct? Yes. What is the meaning of X? What is the meaning of X? That Y is X, so this is Y is A by B times of X. Correct? Sir Y is not X. What is X? How much is A by B? I have to remove it. So, Y is less than Y. Let's say this Y is divided by A by A. No, no, no, no. I have to decrease it for another time. More than H and V is equivalent to some percentage. So, this is a 25 percent increase. So, what I will say is, B is 25 percent more than A. B is 5 by 4 times. And, what will you say? That B is 5 by 4 times more than A. Right? B is 5 by 4 times more than A. What does that mean? What did you add in A? And, it is a 5 by 4 times A. How much is A? It is more than 5 by 4 times. Let's say, I am confused for this to be understood. B is not a. Now, if I have to make B, let's say increase by 25 percent. What does that mean? If I multiply it by 5 by 4, then B is made. Now, if I have to make B, if I have to multiply it by B, then I have to multiply it by 4 by 5. Right? I will multiply it by 4 by 5. Now, let's say X is A by B more than Y. So, here, how much is 25 percent more than 1 by 4? So, A is 1 and B is your 5. So, Y is less than B. How much less than B? This is 1. How much is B? How much is A? What is that? What does that mean? If I have to increase 1 by 25, then B is my 5. How much is B? How much is A? How much is B? How much is A? 25 percent is more. I mean, A is 25 percent. I mean, A is 25 percent. So, B will be the same. If I have to increase 25 percent. So, if I have to increase 20 percent by A, then what is the degree of 20 percent? What is the degree of 20 percent? I mean, if I have to increase 1 by 5, then I will get A. So, this is what is written here. Yes. Now, it is clear. This is what is written here. If B is 1 by 4 A, sorry, if B is 1 by 4 more than A. If B is 1 by 4 more than A. Then Y is, How much will that be? How much will that be? How much will that be? 1 upon 5 less than B. How much will that be? So, what is the degree of B plus 1? 1 upon 5. So, it is written here. If you have to explain it, then just read it. If you have to explain the theory, then what is changing? How does it change? How do we talk about A and what is being discussed? 15% more mangoes then bhavana. bhavana say, kitna zada yaparna ke pas, 50% more. Ska madla, agar ti, 100 ay to, sko 1,15 karsaktao mein. End then, you have to go from 1,15 to 100. Abhise batana kaya hai, that bhavana has how much percentage less mangoes then apar na. kitna hai ye less mein, 15. Now, you are comparing this 15 with a base of 1,15. Yap hai kaayi kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya kaya. Yap hai, base, team, juo kaye, 1,15. Kitna hojaya kaye, percentage terms mein, 5 se kyaan sa nua 3, and 5 se 20. 3. This percentage nikal na hai, pyye kao hai kao kaayi, 300 apon 23. 23 means 1,70, so 3 times 69. Lago kago kitna, 30% kebbas hojaya ye value. 2 should be the kite terms. 1,70 is put nahi hai, jho pehla dari ka da ki, abhavna toopanna 23 ka, increase apadna to abhavna, kitna decrease. Uzi karela, let's see. Uzi karela, 15% 15% ka, fraksional equivalent ka hai? 3.20. Nail. 3.20, 3.20, Is hai to, multi-pline factor ka ho jaya ka? 23 by 20. 23 by 20. Ska matlag isko. Kya ka ka karna paad haga? 20 apon 23. Tavi hai ye value, 100. Bhai offset karna hai. Tavi hai 20 apon 23. Kise kise kko chikar hai. Bhaap ko. 3 ka change hai, over 23. It is a cheap value, ka hai. Ait hitna hai. Teera per cent hai? 3.01. 1.20. Confusing over ye. Tavi hai 23 by 20. 20 by 23. Kise karela, hoi boh, product constant karna kao kao paan mala jho lakha. Teena paan x,y ka, increase. تو یہ A B will be the same in both cases Yes sir So in this case Means as I used to talk here in the product constancy this case that we have to increase something B to decrease something I am saying here in A and B How? This decrease and this decrease Your value will be here From here something has been increased From there you will come to the month Yes sir Means so This is the same as it is to do one cross Don't relate it to that That is good Ok Sometimes you have to work backwards If a certain value X When increased by R% is less than Y X is increasing by R% And this Y is also Y Then what will be the equation? Let's multiply something in this 1 R upon 100 Okay If we are asked to find X Then we write it as 1 L X into something is equal to Y If you want to find X Then what will you do? Y Y Y by this value 1 plus R upon 100 Okay And do this from yourself Means that this is the same Like we are talking about the same thing S I S I S I I I Time value of money In installments we will study the same thing Okay Let's say that any value R% increased So what will you do? Your Y If I give you X I will give you R% increase I will tell you why will it be removed? Yes If I tell you that R% increase is more than Y Then it will be removed Yes Yes Because it will be multiplied by R upon 100 So this will be the way What does it mean? To go from here To divide it It will be divided by R upon 100 Correct? And what was here? X It was given You had to remove Y How to see the situation? How to see the voltage? Here we have to remove this That this value is So what is this value? X 1 plus R upon 100 So what will you do to do to do to backtrack? And divide it Okay Let's understand the question Our store sells shirts at Rs.10, I, 1010 With a profit margin of 8%. What is the cost price of a shirt? Look at this example We are talking about the margin We will study the profit in loss Correct? So what are the two ways? One is only profit and the other is margin What is margin? When When Base is When base is Selling price When selling price is based And when you calculate the profit percentage Then it is known as margin Right? If business newspapers study Then you will see In the language of business Always talking about margin Right? Always Or like Some of the people are talking about The business of water bottles It is very margin In the business of the tapas It is very margin In the business of the tapas It is very margin Correct? When we talk about day to day In the business of the tapas We are always using it It is very margin in this business So what is the meaning of margin? So what is margin? We are not talking about In day to day life S.P. We are not talking about this We know everything How do we take profit percentage? The profit you are If you compare it Then you will get the cost price Correct? The cost you are buying If you compare it Then you will get the cost of You will get the cost of You will get the profit percentage But in day to day life We are not going to the cost price We know the selling price How much is the amount of water bottle It is getting too much water Let us see It is getting too much water So, In the language of the bank What will we talk about? What will we explain? When we will talk about the margin of the water When we will talk about the margin of the water We will say That there is a profit of 2 rupees In the bottle of 1-2 rupees In the bottle of 1-2 rupees In the bottle of 1-2 rupees In the bottle of 1-2 rupees Means Out of 20 rupees What is the 20 rupees? What is the 20 rupees? The selling price of that bottle It is getting too much water You will get the sell price So, this is the margin of the water If you do this 100 percent Then you will get the margin of the water It will get the margin of the water This is no longer a profit percentage This is the margin of the water The margin of the water is Correct If you want to understand When the water is the basis of the water If you compare the profit to SP Then it is known as margin percentage Now the store sells 7-800-10 The selling price is 0.810 The profit margin of that is 8% The profit margin of that is The profit will be so much The profit of 810 This is the value of 8% The value of this is The value of 8% is 0.888 64-100 So, 64.8 is the profit The profit of this is The profit of this is 64.8 So, can you get the cost price from here? How much will it be? 810-10 64.8 Is that clear? Sir, if you cannot get the money If you do a backtrack Then you can get the 750 20 was 20 is 60 Yes If you do a backtracking Then you can get the 750 How is the bank? SP data has a part So, the multi-blank sector 27 by 25 X is the IE for SINKA 20 is Green is it? So, 27 by 25 multi-blank sector XA Increased 8% value So, 8% is the size 27 by 25 multi-blank sector X into 27 by 25 is equal to 810-2781 So, this question is confusing me With this word Profit margin So, let me raise it Here I explained margin But it is ultimately Profit is the right You are right You should read it like this This is not margin However, I have explained the concept of margin This is only profit percentage So, you are right Because it is in points A store sells shirts at Rs.81010 With a profit margin of 8% What does it mean? 810 is the shirt This is selling price And profit percentage Here profit percentage It is 8% So, this value is 1 plus 8 You have to multiply it with 100 This value is reached This value will be 810 1 plus 8 100 How much will this value be 100 into 810 Divide by 108 27 by 4 times 27 by 30 times 25 is equal to 755 So, 750 is the cost Yes, it is right Then, let's get something As such, we get the cost Not margin Not margin However, I have explaining The concept of margin This is only profit percentage تب تھی کہیو کا کیونکی ورنا وہ پویٹس میں آر ہے you are right Astore sells shirts at Rs. 800 & 10 with a profit margin of 8% its ka madlab kya hai 810 pay shirt Aap ne bheji hai this is selling price aur profit percentage ju hai yaape profit percentage it is 8% Tee ke to ye value aap ne nikka le 8% ka madlab hai 1 plus 8 apon 100 se multipli kare kya aap ne iis value pe pochau its ka madlab ye value kitni hojai ki 810 apon 1 plus 8 apon 100 kare kya aap ne ye value kitni hojai ki 100 into 810 divide by 108 27 se 4 time 27 se 30 times tee ke shi ko jai got 25 aur ye ho ka 750 so 750 is the cost yes it's right fere ka kushin type se b yote aap linking different basis let's say in this letter we have dealt with elementary example so far at cat level the questions will have multiple percentage computation like an example below ja say kya aap kare aap in 2019 albert spend 80% of his salary the rest are his savings for the month in the subsequent month he receives a 20% increase in his monthly salary but his expenses for the month also increases by 30% what was the percentage change in his savings in June 2019 kya kaha ni ayar sub se pelle May 2019 albert spend 80% of his salary dek ryo yaha pe base kya ho ba his salary kai ki May 2019 ki rest saving hojai so let's say agar May 2019 ki bata kare aap to salary I don't know kuchi vi value hojai wo let's say it was 100 he na to hushka expenses kya te May 2019 may 80 rupees to hushka savings kittaniKi 20 to what i nk level the questions will have multiple percentage computation like an example below ja say kya aap kya aap kaya aap in 2019 albert spend 80% of his salary the rest are his savings for the month in the subsequent month he receives a 20% increase in his monthly salary but his expenses for the month also increases by 30% What was the percentage change in his savings in June 2019? What is the story? First of all May 2019, Albert spent 80% of his salary. See what will happen here. What will be his salary? May 2019. Rest savings. So let's say, if I am talking about May 2019, then salary, I don't know, will be worth anything. And let's say it was 100. So what are the expenses for May 2019 and 80 rupees? So how much was his savings? 20 rupees. In the subsequent month, so May next, will come June. What will happen in June? He receives a 20% increase in his monthly salary. That is, this 20% increase is done. Which means he is now getting 120. But his expenses for the month also increases by 30%. This expense was 80 rupees. This increased by 30%. How much increased by 30%? By 30% how much is his salary? 24. It has become 104. Which means how much is his savings? How much is his savings? 16 rupees. 16 rupees. So what was the percentage change in his savings in June 2019? What is the change? May 2019. June 2019. What was the percentage change in his savings? 20. So what is the change? 20. Minus 4 of on base 20. Which means minus 1 by 5. Yafir minus 20%? Minus 4. This is 25% decrease. Yes sir. Then questions involving dependencies. Let's say well-power person is divided among five children. Such that A gets 20% B gets 30% of the remainder. C get 40% of the remainder etc. So who will get that? Let's see through the question. Rupee 89,538 was to be paid up as a capital by the four partners. PQR and S. P paid 25% of this amount. Q paid 25% of the remainder. R's capital contribution was four times that of S. If the requirement was exactly covered by these capital contributions, then what was the capital contribution of S? Let's solve the question. Q paid 25% of the remainder. Q paid 25% of the remainder.
