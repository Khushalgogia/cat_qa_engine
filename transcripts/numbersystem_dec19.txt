 Yes, so basically, first of all let's talk about classes. How do you ask how to outspread? I'll start my theory and then if you have doubt, what will you do? You raise your hand. You have to unmute yourself and start speaking. Otherwise, no one will be very angry. So just raise your hand and ask your doubt. If you have a hand raised for four to five people, I'll address it. First of all, if you have any type of doubt, if you think you're being ashamed of it, ask yourself. Just ask yourself. Ask yourself anything, or anything that you're asking. Because I think that you can improve your maths every week. You'll get a doubt. It's okay that you have to add a lot of fractions. However, I'll try to address this problem in theory itself. But if you have a doubt, then you have to ask. Ask yourself. If you open your cameras, ask yourself, at least you have to do it. During the class, you can offer it and read it comfortably. It's okay. If you have a doubt, then you have to face me. I should know how serious you're understanding it. And then, when I'll explain something, I shouldn't have come to you with the idea of your future. I don't want to see videos after I've just come. First, you'll see your videos after you've diluted them. This is the first show of your character. You have to show daily in classes. You're a sincere person. And you see how many people are sincere in classes. The colleges will go to that place. They'll be sincere. The cost of the sincerity is the reward. So, the sincerity of the reward, you'll reap the life. I used to be a hero in the class, but nobody has to see me. I don't have to be a hero anymore. I don't have to do that. I'll study like this. If you want to go to a very far place, you'll have to do all these things. You'll have to skip the classes. You'll have to skip the classes. I'll come to the class and then I'll see. There are two classes. You'll have to complete the class and come with me. I'm telling you, if you stay in the middle, you'll be very upset. And then you'll have to sit for 3-4 months and then sit for the class. And I'm not a cat. I mean, the kids will sit at least 50,000 students. The students will sit with you. I mean, I'll write a second or third time class. They already have an idea. However, you can't complete them like this. In fact, first timers are also 100% tired. This is the thing. So, I'll want you to maintain a sincerity with you. So, let's start today's class. So, we are starting off with a number system. So, numbers are first lectures. We will talk about basics of numbers, definition of numbers. And then what are numbers, basic arithmetic operations? What are the things that they do? Then we will talk about classification of numbers. So that they feel like that. And then we will move on to more complex concepts. So, first lecture is number theory. So, let's talk about basics of numbers. First, let's talk about numbers. What are numbers, basic definition of numbers? What do you think of numbers? So, let's talk about definition of numbers. So, who will tell me what are numbers? The definition that you know. It looks great if you frame it or you know the definition. Then it will tell you. So, let's talk about numbers. I don't know if we have thought about numbers before or not. So, let me ask you first. Before we talk about numbers. So, let's talk about numbers. Because we are not in class second, third, fourth. The teacher is talking about numbers. So, please tell me what are numbers. What are numbers? Yes. Sit down. Yes, some mathematical symbol. Which is called quantity. Some mathematical symbol. Which represents quantity. Okay. Okay. Where are you connecting? Yes. Yes. And. Yes. Who else wants to say what are numbers? Or what do you think of numbers? What are numbers? One, two, three, four, five. These are numbers. Yes. Basically, in any language, in fact, any symbol that you are using, either count something, either to measure something, like time or distance. And basically, describe every day objects and activities. Yes. So, you call them numbers. Yes. It's true. But, the symbols, symbols are not numbers. You both have common one thing. Where you were saying, symbols used. Symbols are not numbers. But, yes. Numbers, numbers are an abstract concept. Right. So, if I say, I am a definition, numbers are the mathematical object. Let's call it a value. So, numbers are mathematical object. Mathematical object used to count. Yes. What Gyaasa said. Or, measure. Or, label something. Right. These are numbers. What do I mean by numbers? Number is a mathematical object, which we use to count something. Right. First of all, what will happen? First of all, people, when they didn't know anything about the start, they would have objects. Right. So, how will they count? Or, think of them, who have catals. Or, they have the weapons. How will they count? If there is any object, if there is object, they will have to count. The system or the abstract concept that you use, that is known as numbers. Right. You use it to measure something. You use it to label. Mobile phones. Right. You type a mobile phone number. You type a mobile number. So, you label it to your numbers. So, those are numbers. But, you talk about symbols. For example, we read a 1, like 2, 3, 4. We read them. Right. These are not numbers, but numerals. These are numerals. Numerals. So, numbers are different in numerals. Numerals. These are numerals. Numerals are symbols. Symbols. Which we use to represent the count of something. And, if I use count, which means, I am saying number. Right. To represent the number, symbol, you use it. That are numerals. Right. Like 1, 2, 3, 4. What does it mean? This is the 4th. It has been ingrained. We read it since childhood. 4, 4, 4, 4. In fact, when I am saying, I can also use this word, F or UR. This also means something. 4, this symbol also means something. And, the meaning. And, the meaning. This meaning, which is telling, that is known as number. So, this is the number, is something abstract. Right. And, how do you represent it? Either by symbols. Symbols. Which is symbol. It is called as numeral. This is known as numeral. Right. Or, words, you can signify it. Word means F or UR. Okay. What does it represent? This symbol and this word represent. What does it represent? For example, I say, if arrows are 1, 2, 3, 4. Counting is the same. So, these are how many arrows? Four arrows. Now, how do you represent this abstract counting? By this symbol, 4 numerals. By word, 4. I could have said that this symbol was to signify it. To signify it. The count of 4. We can also use this symbol. This could be used for counting 4 objects. So, these numbers are numerals. They are universally accepted symbols. The numbers we have assigned to them in that value is known as number. Number means you have to do count. So, the concept of that is known as number. I hope it is clear now. To signify them, we use numerals. Words, words, words. In fact, different geographically, these are all classifications. Like, if you talk about the symbol system, we use this decimal system. It is actually an Indo-Arabic numeral system. Where we use 10 digits. I will explain the Indo-Arabic. Indo-Arabic numeral system. Where we use 10 symbols. To signify numbers. Where we use 0 to 9 digits. I will say that if you want to tell us the count of 90, this is the number. This is the symbol actually. To represent the count of 90. This is the Indo-Arabic numeral system. In the childhood, we will study the Roman system. Where we count this way. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. It is represented in a different way. And there are many uses. Like, a particular set of places. For example, in the last 10th, we are always using Roman numerals. These are numerals. And different reasons are specific. Like, the Roman system was started in the old Rome. To represent numbers. This was all the systems. Those were the challenges. The Indo-Arabic numeral system was used. Chinese have their symbols. But, you will remember all the symbols. They only represented 10 symbols. We will represent numbers. Counting will be all. So, numbers are used to measure or count something. How do you signify using numerals or words? Or, how do you write in Hindi? In a language, we write 4. This is 4. 4 means, count of 4. This is just a word. In Hindi, I will write it in Hindi. Or, if you talk about the script of the divine agri, you will see 4 in Hindi. I write 4 in Hindi. This is 4. It is also used to represent counting of 4. The numbers are clear. There is a number-a-captured concept. Where do you start with numbers? For counting something. If you have any things to eat, then you have 4 laddoos. Or, 5 laddoos. How do you count them? These are the systems that make a symbol. The symbol that I have signify. This is the count of 5. I have 5 laddoos. This symbol. I will write it in English. I will also write 5 in Hindi. This is the concept of numbers. First of all, let's talk about the next. Let's talk about the numerical systems. The Roman numerical system. These symbols are used. This is used for 1. I have told you that I have V is used for 5. X is used for 10. L is used for 50. C 100. D is used for 500. And M is used for 1000. Now, what are the challenges of this Roman numerical system? First of all, Count of nothingness. You don't have anything. How do you show it? This is 0. There is no concept of 0. There is no system to represent 0. You have to take this. These are symbols. We have to sit down. I don't want to talk about base system. We are counting. We are understanding everything through these numbers. This is why we are representing all these numbers. For example, Count of 1. In Roman numerals, this symbol will be used. What does it mean? I have told you numbers of numbers. You can't tell me the numbers here. You can write many numbers. Or I would have challenged you to write fractions. How would you represent fractions? When you learn to count, then you will have such a situation. How do you do this count? When you have half of something. If this is a Laddu, how do you count them? You can't write in Roman numerals. How do you represent half? In the Indo-Europe numerals system, in the Arabic numerals system, where we use 0 to 9 10 digits. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. These are the symbols used to represent count of nothingness. This is 0. Count of nothing. Count of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. And all these numbers can be made from combinations. These are the symbols that we will remember. In fact, let's talk about counting. We will learn better when we are reading base system. What is the base system? We can make many base systems. We can make many base systems. In the Indo-Europe numerals system, let's write this number. In fact, if I write 486, what is this? We can also represent all these numbers. We can use 9 10 to 10. We can use these symbols to increase count. We can also use 11 12 13. And then we can reach 100 and then we can reach 150. So this is the 15th position. If I start with 0, nothing. Then where the count is increased, where the positional value is reached on the 15th. Or we can say count of 150. And we can do this and we can call it 486. So, you can explain the infinite numbers. You can count the infinite objects. From this numeral system. So this is about a numeral system. It is not a question of its own. It is just a feeling of a person. So that you can see the base system in reading. And if you have any definition, ask the numbers. Or if you search for any other number after reading the lecture. If you don't have any information, you have an internet. You just type the word numbers. And then you can read the VHRC. You can also get ready for RTC. Let's read it. VKPD also says that what is the definition? If you ask the local GDP, and in fact, what is the Bangalore Calcutta? What is the line? What do you know about line? What is the concept line? So, these things are asked. So, you have to be aware of these definitions. Then let's talk about basic arithmetic operations first. In numbers, what can we do now? For example, I am taking it in starting. First, I am covering it. What are the basic arithmetic operations? Let me give you an idea. Everyone knows that. It is the basic arithmetic operation. What we do in numbers. If I add count, for example, 1, 2, 3, these are 3 apples. These are 3 apples. Let me add 2 apples. What will I get? These are 5 apples. So, this is addition. Add it. It is represented by sign, this plus sign. If you want to add 2 more numbers, then you will use this mathematical operator. This is known as plus. Then we have a subtraction. And mind you, these small mistakes will be in your questions. You may be very small. What are you talking about addition subtraction? The last second thing is, No. We do it yesterday. There are many people who play plus and minus. They are at a negative, big number. They are at a negative, small number. They are very small. Subtraction, you can represent this as, what is the meaning of subtraction? Difference. If I add 2 objects in 3, then I have two objects. What is the difference? That is subtraction. Then third is multiplication. And next operation is a division. Then we have, now all these basic operations, these are 4 basic operations. I have to talk to myself about some other operations. Because when we are solving the cat's questions, you will see that you have used powers here. You have not studied about some power yet. So let's use that concept also. Exponunciation. Right? And then root. And one more mathematical operation is log algorithm. Log. Because we will study in many ways. Don't worry. It is a good thing. But when log comes, you will understand. What is mathematical operation? Just like addition. If you put a operation on numbers, then log. Next, we will talk about it. Addition subtraction multiplication. You know that division symbol is this. Right? This is this. Okay. Add what you will get. That is sum. What is there? You have difference. If you have two numbers, this is product. And here, what is there from two numbers? What is there from two numbers? Right? That means, you have written 6 divided by 2. What you got? You are comparing it. Yes. You got fraction. So what you will get here? Fraction. Ratio. Or quotient. Right? This is not a big deal. Just understand. Exponunciation means, Exponent. Or you also say power. Yes, you also say degree. I think addition subtraction multiplication. About division, I need to explain. I will do it again. If you talk about addition, you will get 2 numbers. Add sign. 4. This is a difference. Now, here, I don't want to introduce anything. Negative numbers. Because I haven't classified them yet. But, if I have minus 2 here, and plus 2 is doing it, then this is the operation. Right? This is a number. This is a negative 2. Negative numbers are also there. When you add them, what will you get? You will get zero. So, the addition is, it doesn't matter that the number you are adding, what is the order? Right? First, you can do it anywhere. You can write numbers 2. You will be the same. But subtraction matters. Remember. If I talk about 4 minus 2, then you will get this result. 4 minus 2 is minus 4. So, you get the count of 2. Right? Now, if I write mathematically, if instead of this, I write 2 minus 4. What do you get? Minus 2. This is the entire idea. You get minus 2. Minus 2, why? Because this count of negative numbers. This, this. You are, if I try to show you visually, then I will give you 2 things. 2 things. You will have to think about it. You have to do 4 minus 4. So, these 2 went. 2 and you have to do minus. So, what is the relation between you? This is not the number. Where is the number of these? So, these 2 numbers. If you have to do 4 minus 2, then how is that possible? When you have this minus 2. How is this possible? Confused. That's why we use this symbol. What will you do in subtraction? When number, this count is big, then what will you do? Negative. The result will be in negative. You use this. If we read the real line, then it is easy for you. Write it minus 2. But now, I have so much expectation that this will be the idea that this number is bigger than 2. So, you will write minus 2. Talk about multiplication. What is multiplication? If I use 3 into 5. It is 15. We remember tables. So, what is multiplication? It is nothing. But, I am adding this value. This number. How many times? How many times? How I am technically doing this? I am adding 5.5. What is the result of this? I have 15. And this is something. 3 times 5. What have you used? I am saying this. If I say 2 into 3 into 5. What is this? So, you add. First, use these two. So, 2 into 3 is 6. Use 3 2 times. 3 plus 3 is 6. Then, 6 into 5. 6 into 5 is 30. When you use 5 6 times. So, this was the means of tables. I will say this about tables. If you are mathematically so sound. You know all this. From inside. So, you don't need to remember tables. For example, if I say 17 into 9. You don't know this. You don't need to use tables. You can remove this. 17 into 9. I mean, use 17 times. This is what I am telling you. Or use 9 to 17. This is a small number. So, I have to add 9 times. You can't do this. I can add 10 times. I know that I get 170. And I minus 1 time. So, I get how much? 153. Here I get. So, I remember tables. Remember how you solve this. This is the reason. So, this is multiplication. Devision is nothing but the inverse operation of multiplication. Multiplication is the inverse of the division. For example, what is the inverse? If I multiply this 2 by 3. I multiply it with the inverse. 1 by 2 is the inverse of 1 by 2. If you say the inverse, what is the inverse? Which give me the result? 1. If the product of this is 1, then you will say the inverse. Remember this definition. So, the inverse will be 1 by 2. So, you multiply it with 1 by 2. So, you are technically dividing 3 by 2. If I try to tell you the division, what is the meaning of division? There were 3 objects. There were 3 objects. These are 3 types of numbers. And you are dividing them by 2. That means, you have to make 2 2 packets. You have to divide them in 2 2 packets. So, you can see that these 2 packets can be made. And can it be made? No. So, you can divide this number by 2. As, what do you write as the result of the division? This is 1.5. Or you write 1 time in fractions. You write 1 whole 1 by 2. How is this? Or what do you say? You get this quotient and 1 as remainder. So, the division has a reason. You can give me an idea once again. That if you divide 3 by 2, then you write this number as 1. So, let us write 2 here. 2. You have to write this product as the number of the number. And this is your quotient. And if you subtract it from here, then you have to make a remainder. Reminder means left over value. When you divide this number, this 3 is known as Divident. This Divident, when you divide by this divisor, divisor, you get this quotient. Right. And this value, one is a remainder. Reminder. If you want to understand this, then you will get a bigger number. For example, if I divide 20 by 5. What does 20 by 5 mean? Like you know, you have to keep 20 marbles. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. So, the visual representation is the reason. What is the meaning of this? You divide these 20 marbles into 5-5 packets. So, let's see, the first packet is made by your 5. The second packet is this, the third packet is this, and the fourth packet is this. Right. So, 5 completely divides this number. How many times 4? This 4 is nothing but quotient. And this quotient is nothing, but these packets, how many packets can be made of 5? To get this value 20. Right. If here 21 is, 21 divided by 5, then 1 marble extra will be left over is known as remainder. You can give this much of the remainder in the idea. We will study this concept very well. Let's see. And algebraically, how do you write this division? Divident is equal to divisor into quotient plus remainder. This is algebraically. Right. Now, I want to tell you about the exponent. This should be a little idea. Right. What is the exponent? It is 2 raised to the power of 3. What does it mean? Power. This concept. What is the operation? What is the exponent? What is the exponent? Who should we call exponent? This number. This number is your 2. The top is written here. The top is written here. We call it exponent. Or power. Right.right or degree many all these names Exponent What is the meaning of this operation? What is the meaning of this operation? This is very good I used to come to the addition subtraction Multiplacation division Exponent What is the meaning of this operation? This base This 2 is known as base This base is multiplied by itself How many times This much or this many times 2 into 2 into 2 So you get the value as 8 2 into 2 is 4 4 into 2 is 8 So exponent is nothing If a number is added to the power of A This is known as exponent Right? You can also say power of Degree You can say exponent of Degree And this is your base This is your base This base is This means that you have to multiply this base How many times You have to multiply this base A into A and so on How many times B times B number of times Now you have to multiply this as 4 to the power 5 What is the meaning of 4 to 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 If this basic definition is clear to you You can also say something You can also say something For example I am saying one thing or Tell me quickly If I write this expression 4 raised to 5 into 4 raised to the power 6 or small numbers You will have a problem 4 raised to the power 2 and 4 raised to the power 3 Tell me the answer Is this operation? What? I have used all these operations I have used all these operations 4 to the power 5 This is a basic idea Exponents will be good This is a basic idea But for the time being This is a basic idea 4 squares is nothing But 4 into 4 4 cube is nothing But 4 into 4 into 4 So how many total powers are there? 5 powers Because 4 is multiplied by itself 5 times Now 2 plus 3 is 5 2 plus 3 is 5 3 or 2 You are adding 4 power 4 is multiplied by the same And when you divide If I write this expression 4 raised to the power 3 Divide by 4 square So many of you You have a correct answer That is not the problem Now if you divide 4 square You are simply 4 into 4 into 4 When you divide this expression So we know 4 4 get cancelled 4 4 get cancelled You get 4 4 raise to the power 1 And how do you get 1? What do you think? You have minused this power So if you divide the same In the same way You get 3 minus 2 4 raise to the power 1 This is known as Exponentiation Exponent means Next operation is Root Root will be heard I will do some more space here Because it is necessary to explain Root is needed It is needed to feel Because we are talking about Exponents Roots are not far behind For example I will tell you the root of 9 Tell me the root of 9 Root is 3 Tell me 16 square root What is the root of 16? 4 4 4 2 questions are valid You have said 3 4 Is this complete? Is this complete? 9 square root is 3 16 square root is 4 No Yes, tell me What is the complete answer? Yes, now you are In line Yes, now you are Yes, it can be plus or minus 3 Plus or minus 4 This is not complete This is the math So first I need to know the definition Then I will talk about it This is not complete Minus 3 Minus 4 Here is the root What is the root? Root is a number Or you are talking about the direct nth root In some number So let's take this definition That nth root Of x In some number nth root of x Is a number R Which When raised to Which when raised to Power n Power n yields x Okay, is this definition clear? What does it mean? In some number x If you are going to take nth root Then first of all x And we use this symbol If I write n here So I am talking about nth root of this number nth root of this number Is some number R What is the definition of this? When raised to The power n I will get This number x Will get x I will use this definition And I will take it For example This is What does the root mean? This symbol So we assume it as 2 This is Nothing but square root If you assume x You will get 3 You will say Q root If you write nth root If I talk about 9th square root 9th square root Is a number R What is the definition of this? When raised to this R To the power 2 Now tell us What can we use? You can use plus 3 This R This is plus 3 Because you can also give the square 9th square 9th square So we need to be clear That this square root of nth yields 2 What will be the root? 3 and minus Okay? Now tell us The negative number We will talk about Positive real number I have got the square root One more concept Negative The square root So we will read the number There Or in real numbers This part will be the complex number Yes, negative numbers Negative numbers Square root Or nth root is defined But for complex numbers We will not read them We will just take the idea But I did not understand the reason I have cleared the case I am using positive numbers I have to read it So these are the basic operations If you have any Please take the copy and read it And this is the first lecture I told you If you read it And read it And read it And read it And read it And read it And read it And read it And read it And read it Look at how those are The following They have mine Those have mine So these are the subjects Because numbers are now used only. So, we need to explain this. Let's move on to the next. So, this is our story. More operators, the same story, route or explanation. You have this question. We have already told you a lot of times. Now, you need to answer this question. Let's solve it. I know, that Kira won't come from inside. He will give us a list of answers. I am never able to answer that. You have to answer this question. You have to do this. You have to do this. You have to approach this question. Because cat asks this. All the exams also ask. You test it on questions. So, see what is the difference between this question. Don't say that you are not a good question. You come from a good question. So, cat, you will check basic understanding through your questions. For example, this question, you will answer this question. But, I can ask this question in modern maths. I am counting you to some condition. Count those numbers. So, the question of PNC is, right? But basic concept is maths. All of you, take it out. Okay. Answer is coming. Try it. Try it. It is important. Yes. 3 plus minus 3. All of you are giving some answers. Take it out. I will try it. Question is given. When a 3 digit number is reversed, we get another 3 digit number. Right? So, I have assumed that ABC is a 3 digit number. ABC. So, what is this ABC represented? Digits. Right? This place is, it is unit's place. Right? Number. It is 10th place and it is 100th place. 100th place. Right? So, ABC is a 3 digit number. When you reverse it, you get CBA. This is a 3 digit number. IMACA difference. Kadiya wa 297. Then, what is the difference between 100th and the unit's digit of the number? Then, you have to tell 100th digit. What is A? And, what is the unit's digit? C. They say, you have to tell the difference. The difference is nothing. The same operation, subtraction. You have to tell how much it will cost. So, let's see. If you try to do this here, you do not have these digits. ABC, what are the digits? You do not know. Right? So, I will give you a look at all of them. I will focus on two things here. I will focus on two things. First thing is, No number. You should also say that you should use 3 digit number. 3 digit number. You should use. So, 3 digit number. You should use. So, it is ABC. This is your number. So, how will this number look like? Like, 342. Like this. Okay? If I talk about its value, this is the number. But its value. If you talk about value, if you assume a number, by these alphabetical letters, then how do you write the value? For example, 342, what happens? This is nothing but 300 plus 440 plus 2. This is what it means. Units 100 and unit 100s. This is the A. What can you write about its value? A into 10 raised to the power 2. Because A is 100 times. Right? B, what is B? When you add this B into 10 raised to the power 1 and C into 10 raised to the power 0. So, we will come to this. This is because what does value signify about any number? We will study based systems. We use this based system of 10 units or 10 digits. So, this is the power of 10. Because, what does this count unit of the unit of the unit show? How many units have you counted? This represents nothing. 1, 2, 9. Now, when you count 9, what is the number? Your 1010. That means, this unit is again hit by the count of the digit. And this count of 10 digit. Now, what happened here? What is the number? You counted 10 cycles. So, you have counted this cycle of 10 one time. If this is 40, what is the number? This is the unit digit of the 10 digits. How many times you count 10 cycles? So, you take the number of the value you have. It is nothing but 340 and 2. This is the number you have assumed. What is the value of this? 8 to 10 square, b to 10 raised to the power 1 plus c into 10 raised to the power 0. So, power 0 means I understand. That means, I might ask you the truth. But, that's why I say ask you the heart of any one. There is no shame in this. If you say 10 raised to the power 2, that's why I clearly explained it. 10 raised to the power nothing. 10 is multiplied by itself. And anything raised to the power 0. Sorry, I forgot to tell you this. It is always 1 except 0. Except 0. If you have 0 power, that means 1. Except it is 0 raised to the power 0. It is undefined in our domain. We are studying it in calculus. In class 12, we are studying engineers. We have not done anything else. So, I have written the value of number. How much is 100 a plus 10 b plus c. That is my number value. What number was this? ABC. ABC. If I reverse it, I get cb a. Now, how will I see cb? 100 times of c plus 10 b plus a. This will be seen. And if the difference between these two numbers, let's see the difference between these two numbers. What did you do? You subtracted them. You subtracted these numbers. So, you get 100 a minus a is 99 times of a. 10 b or 10 b cancels. And then you have 100 c minus of 100 c plus c. So, minus times 99 c. And this is given as 297. Now, what can you tell from here? As you will get 99 common, what will be a minus c? And it is equal to 297. So, here, what will be a minus c value? Just divide this number by 99. So, this is nothing but 300 minus 3 or 99 100 minus 1. You can write it. So, it becomes 3. So, what is the difference between 100 and units digit? Units or 100s digit? What difference has come from you? 3. But, what is 3? There is a few people's answer minus 3. Let's see why they are saying this. Why they are saying this? If there is a number, there is a number, this is the number. 291. If I reverse it, I get 192. If I take a difference, how will it come? If I take a difference, how will it come? If I write the number, I get 192. Now, when I I will reverse it, so I get 291. Now, these two numbers will be the difference. How much? Now, it will be the same, but you are doing minus c in the bottom. So, what will you write? Minus time something. Minus time something. So, this difference is positive and negative. Or it will depend on that units digit or 100s digit? What is the big digit? And, on its basis, you will find what the number will come. However, this question is that number is reversed, we get another 3 digit number. If the difference between 2 numbers, this is the language that these two numbers have different to 27. Now, what number should we do first? What number should we do? You don't know. So, you both will get the cases. Both the cases, when difference is 297, this could also happen that you have taken this number from this number. So, what is c minus a, c minus a would be equal to 3. And a minus c, which you had to remove, in this case, it would be minus 3. So, you will get both these values. plus minus 3. What is the difference between hundreds and units digit? plus minus 3. So, here, maybe you will get the number of the number, but you can get the difference of values. That's why, you didn't see the answer that how it will come out, but as soon as you started thinking that you reached here. I hope it is clear. If no one is there, please ask. If you want to ask something here, or else, come forward. It's clear, right? Everyone write C, write all of them. At least, you will find out. If no one is asking like this. Type C, C, C, all clear. Yes, yes, yes, good. Next. So, here, if you want to tell the numbers, basic funder, which I wanted to tell you once. Let's talk about now type of numbers. It's their importance. Because we are going back to our domain. It means, we have to study from the bottom of the field. But we have to know about what are real numbers, what are rational numbers. What are their definitions? We should tell them. If we write the options in the cat, they will tell us, in fact, the cat asked which number is rational or rational. Ask questions. Ask questions. If you want to test today, you can do it. That's why definitions are important. Okay? So, when we have studied basic numbers, now let's talk about the classification of numbers. So numbers are broadly classified in two parts. Real number and unreal numbers. The number used by the numbers, they are divided in two broad categories, real and unreal. What are real numbers? These are the numbers which can be represented on a number line. You can represent the number line. That is your real numbers. And what are the unreal numbers? You also call them imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers. What we were talking about now. Complex numbers. Complex numbers. We study there. Imaginary numbers. We are not doing anything to us. Unreal numbers or imaginary numbers. So, what is the most important thing for us? Unreal numbers. Because they are outside our levels. We are not studying them. Real numbers which can be represented on a number line and unreal, which we can't represent on a number line. Now, you will say, what is the number line? So, you can see this line. You can extend one here and this is the same. So, you can think that all the numbers in this world can be represented on this. These are all real numbers. We have studied all the numbers, calculations, these are all real numbers. And we can represent them on a real number line. It is a small concept. But I will tell you one important thing. This is a number line. You have to plot numbers. It is a field of numbers. Where will you get the number line? That is very important. Because this is something that you cannot forget. Especially, if I talk about LJF, please come to the next number line. We will always come to the next number line. Because, what is the second question? Find the number of solutions. Find the number of integral solutions. Find the number of integral values. How many integral values will be used? How do you get all these? Or solve these equalities. X minus 5 is greater than 2x plus 3. How do you solve this? This is the problem that we get. It is all related to number line. So, you can think like this. A imaginary line exists all the numbers. What do you think of numbers? You know the middle value is 0. It represents nothing. You have nothing. You will represent it by 0. What happens on this number line? There is a fix on space. And numbers represent. For example, here, on the unit digit, number 1. Now, if you constate this difference I am going to represent all the numbers here. So, we know 1, 2, 3, 3. What is all this? We read numbers. Counting values is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. In this, 1 count increases. Every time, a constant count of 1 is increasing every time. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And you increase the infinite times. So, how all the numbers will be on the right-hand side? Even these numbers are said to be something. Yes, they are real numbers because they are on number line. But they have some special name. They have natural numbers. They have integers as well. Right? So, we will come to classification. But right-hand side is all. They are also saying positive numbers. Because they are, they come with a positive sign. You can't see here. Negative numbers are used to show you negative signs. This minus sign. Right? So, these are also positive numbers. So, as you go along this right side, you get positive numbers. Numbers increase as we move from left to right. What will happen to us on this number line? If we move on the right-hand side, what will happen to us? We will increase. We will increase numbers. That means, the count that will increase, the number that represents the count will always increase. And if you go to this left side, numbers decrease. So, 0 is what happens behind. What is in the body of 0? Negative numbers. We will study negative numbers. Here, negative numbers are introduced. So, all the numbers are introduced on the line. And this unit distance is 0. You get negative side. So, you get minus 1, minus 2, minus 3, minus 4, minus 5, and up till minus infinity. Right? Here, negative infinity exists. And if you go along this left-hand side, what will happen to you if you go to left? We will decrease. Numbers decrease. Right? This is an important thing. Now, you are thinking, here, 1, 2, 3, you have shown. No, all the numbers exist here. If I talk to you, you have fractions here too. And fractions are also numbers. One more point is 0.05 for showing. So, the count of 1 will represent here. Where will the point 5 be? If I go along 1, I will only go along. So, this is nothing but 1.5. Right? Or 2.87. How will I represent it? So, I know that the count of 2 is complete. Right? After that, there is a little fractional part. We are introducing a word in the fractional part. Where will it be? That means, this complete part is not complete. It will decrease from the other side. So, maybe this value will be 2.87. In fact, if you talk to me, root 2. This is the rational number. Where are you showing? Yes, you know root 2 value. 1.414. This is a proximate value. Actually, this value never terminates nor it repeats. Root 2 is the rational number. I will talk about it. But, this is also the proximate value. 1.414. This means, where will this value be? 1.4 from the first one. So, this is some root 2. So, all the numbers on real number line are here. In fact, if you write any number like this, 367 divided by 492. What is this? 0.0. 0.xx. This means, this will exist here. Right? So, if I ask you this question, I believe that in the middle of 0 to 1, how many real numbers exist? Can you tell me about their count? Yes, how many real numbers exist? From this 0 to 1 gap, infinite. This is a small number. I can do it a lot. I will zoom in. I will show you small numbers. And I can divide these smaller bits into infinite numbers of times. Right? So, in between them, we also exist infinite numbers. How will they be numbers? 0.1. They will be small from 1 to 1. So, how many numbers? They can represent the real number line as real numbers. They can't represent the real numbers. If you look at the real number, you can see the minus square root of minus 3. Right? You write this as 3 Iota. In this case. Because Iota is nothing but square root of minus 1. These are complex numbers. There are no more of these. If we come once in algebra, we will discuss. So, these are imaginary numbers. You can't represent them here. They don't exist on the number line. So, these are real. Let's talk about classification of real numbers. Okay? In numbers, real and real, then real classification and two broad classification of real numbers are rational and irrational numbers. Both of them are their own. There is a little bit of an idea. But if I go to the definition, what will I say? Real numbers are such numbers that I can represent the form of P by Q. Right? If I represent the number of P by Q, I will say rational numbers. But with conditions. P by Q, where? Where? PQ? Plans to integer. Now, integer is not here. I am also saying this. You can say that this number here is not the irrational value. It is the integer value of PQ. Like minus 2 plus 2 plus 3 is the type of number. P or Q? And Q is not equal to 0. You think, this is a very interesting thing. For example, I will tell you this. 2 by 0 is what? Let's write in the chat. 2 by 0 is what? I said this is not a rational number because rational numbers what happens? P by Q can represent them in the form. Where Q is not equal to 0. Q is 0. It will not be equal to the number of P. So, Q is 0. If it is, then what do I say about this interesting thing? Okay, not defined. Undefined. Undefined. I wanted to hear what Kushal says. Infinite. Yes. Undefined. Very good. So, people are saying undefined. This is the only problem. Kushal, what is the problem? I want to say it infinite. This is not infinite. But you approximate this expression. You divided 2 by 2. It is very small. Approaching to 0. If you use this definition, when some number is approaching to 0, it is very small. And if you divide 2 by 2, then how many parts? How many? How many? How many? But this is only the approximation. When we read calculus, then we read about this. But 2 upon 0, it is undefined. It is undefined. Right? Because basic definition, you use 3 by 2. 3 by 2. It is some number x. What does it mean? This expression is its value x. If you multiply 2 by 2, you get 3. Okay? If you agree here, you say, number 2 by 0, it is some number y. So, 0 into y, then can I get 2? Never. 2 will not get 2. That is why, it cannot be a number. What do you say in infinite? There is a number in infinity. In infinite, it means, you are equating some value. But that value can never be exact. Because 0 into y can never be 2. So, it is undefined always. It is undefined and not infinite. Okay? So, your definition of rational numbers that those numbers which can be represented in P by Q form, where PQ belongs to integer and Q is not equal to 0. Q0 now, as is, what will be the number of numbers? Rational number. For example, if you look at 3 by 10, it is a rational number. 7 by 9, this is a rational number. Or can you present these numbers in decimal form? Fractions, this is improper fraction. Now we will talk about the fraction form. The decimal form of the fraction is 17.8. And 22 by 7. What are all these numbers? What are all your rational numbers? Alternately, rational numbers are those which have digits repeating after a certain point in the decimal system after the decimal point. Or if you give a second definition of rational number, what will happen? If you write this number in the decimal system, then in the decimal, this digit either they repeat, or terminate. If you say, then repeat, this is the only solution. It was not only repeat, for example, if you don't have to repeat, it is not repeat, it is terminated here. This is a rational number. Right? Rational. If I talk about it, 4.333333 and 3 repeat, it will happen. When will it happen? 4.33333? Which expression will it give me? Tell me. When will it happen? It is not the value of the fraction. 4.33. Can I write 40 by 9? Yes. 36. 4 will be saved. 36. 36. 36. 36. 36. 36. 36. 36. 36. This is something else. 4. So 13 by 3. Yes. 13 by 3. 13 by 3. You divide it. You get 4.33333. And, but 13 by 3. Rational number is the number of PYC. Because the form is represented. PQ. Integers. And Q is not equal to 0. So, Rational number. If you look at a second definition. Q is 30 by 9. 39 is not equal to 9. This is something else. 30 by 9. If you want to do 9, 39 by 9 will be equal to 9. If you look at this. If you multiply it from 3 to 3, then 39 by 9. Now, what we have to convert it. So, what are the rational numbers? We will always be repeated and terminate. After decimal point. This is decimal point. Either they terminate. So, I will write here. So that you remember. Either they terminate. Right. Or repeats. Or repeats. Okay. Now, the second part of this is the irrational numbers. So, the number you can't represent in PYQ form. Or the second definition. Jokey. Non-terminating. And non-repeating. Numbers which are. Which are. Non-terminating. Non-terminating. And non-repeating. And non-repeating. Right. What does this mean? Route 5. What is the value of Route 5? What is the value of Route 5? 2.2 something. 2.2 and so on. Right. Now, this is the number the number. It will never terminate at 4.2. Not like that. It will never terminate. Also, it does not repeat. It will never repeat. It will never repeat. This number will be closed. Right. And the example of numbers. jithne bhi square root saktne pasi. the square root of 5 square root of 7 square root of 17, 2 root 3 these are all irrational numbers. Pi, jithne bhi constants we use for physics we read physics, we read in the math, in fact in maths the circle area. so this Pi is defined as When areas divided by diameter you get this pi constant. So this constant pi is irrational number. This is irrational number. Epsilon, theta, all these are e, this is also 3.14 something. These are irrational numbers. We will never repeat this. We will never terminate. So this definition is the real two definitions. The rational and irrational part of the real is the rational number and irrational number. Now I will answer you one question. Sorry. Rational terminates and repeat. Irrational which are non-terminating and non-repeating. This is the only definition of irrational number. This is the only definition of irrational number. I want to ask you one question. What is written here? Question. Okay. You tell me which of the following number is irrational? Okay. You have to tell us which number is irrational. 1, 2, 3, 4. I will give you four options. So. Okay. This is a 3 by 7. Yes. Let's do this. Let's do this. Yes. Let's do 3 by 7. And. 2 is the third. 3 by 8. And. 2 by 5. And. 4 by 9. This is the irrational number. Or at any time, one second, one second, two or a half. This number is. I think what? 22 by 7. Right? I am asking you which number is irrational. Yes. Tell me. We are talking about irrational numbers. Irrational. Yes. Everyone will answer. Tell me. Write something. The answer I wanted was to get. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Now you are in the online. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Let me start. Yes. We saw a lot. We saw a lot of these numbers. We saw a lot. Yes. Yes. And we see through the difference. It was the result. We saw it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We saw the difference. Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. P by Q So going by the definition we can say these all numbers are rational None is irrational You have doubt of 22 by 7 Because Right now I have told you the example of irrational is pi Right Who will explain this thing? What is the reason? Is there anyone? Interesting Who please hand raise And tell me Will it start working once? Will I explain it? Is it 22 by 7? How is it irrational? When pi is irrational? Yes Kunal please speak Yes sir So as far as I am aware 22 by 7 itself is a normal fraction Right We approximate pi and get that value Exactly Very good Very good That's all I had to say Pi is approximated to 22 by 7 Right 22 by 7 Now all people have opened their copy Who wrote 22 by 7 Right Paru will Prithika, Paru will You all right Try once 22 by 7 Let's divide this number Try in your copies Let's try with you So 3 times 21 1 aya And then 0.0 1 times is 7 3 aya 0 4 times 28 2 aya Then 20 Then 2 times Just this 14 Then 6.0 8 times is 56 And you get 4 Then 40 Then 5 times is 35 And you get 5 Then 0.7 times is 49 And finally you get 1 Now you can see What I was saying was It will be understood What is this? 3.14 2857 You all are watching All of you said Irrational 22 by 7 Irrational definition What was this decimal What should be done after this decimal Non-repeating Non-terminating These numbers repeat But in this case When you divide by 7 You see one is here 1 as it will come Then you will make it 10 And the car will run from here How? 142857 142857 So 22 by 7 The value of value is 3.14 2857 Okay This means This value will repeat You can't see this That's why it is a little bit of a question What is it? But none of these are Irrational numbers Irrational is Pi Pi value You take 3.14 Why did you take 3.14? Now 2 decimals What you have done after this You have approximated Pi is an Irrational number 22 by 7 is a rational number Remember this thing This is irrational And this is rational This is also rational number So let's approximate What will we repeat? But the value of Pi is It is 3.142857 And you have to search If you read about Pi Then these numbers will never be terminated If you read about root 2 The value of root 2 is 1.414 And the number of numbers It will never be terminated It will never be repeat So it is known as Irrational Remember this Okay? You can't represent Pi in this form Okay If I tell you root 2 by root 3 How is this number? Is it rational or irrational? Tell me You can't represent Pi in this form I did it But why was it 22 by 7? They are in Irrational numbers example No, it was not Look, this was in which example? Rational numbers example 22 by 7 I didn't write Sorry, if you read it This is not irrational All these numbers were written in rational numbers Isn't it? Irrational Pi is written It is not 22 by 7 Pi is irrational number Pi's value 22 by 7 It is approximated to 22 by 7 You have approximated this value Next, I will answer this Root 2 by root 3 Rational is irrational Very good Everyone says irrational Not now This number will be irrational Because it is rational definition Although it is Pi by Q form But what else is P and Q? It was condition P by Q P by Q belongs to integer It should be integral If you use this irrational number So, Pi by Q form Irrational will be said It is not like You have represented Pi by Q form Because Pi by Q form Clear Here, definition is given P by Q belongs to integers Integral numbers should be PQ So, it is not like this Irrational will be here Any combination of these square roots, Q groups And through it It is always rational It is always rational Or the constants Pi is here It is very low And many constants Physics Mathematics All these are irrational numbers Now We will go deeper into rational numbers About the reputation The reputation of the power And the reputation of the decimal And what is the meaning of this? Let's talk about it I will erase it from here First point is Terminating decimals Numbers Look What is here? Rational Rational number What can be two types? One is Terminating decimals And decimals Terminating Or what can be repeated? Or repeating And non-terminating Non-repeating Irrational That is a different world Terminating For this It is important to say That terminating decimals Decimals Have only some powers of Two or five in the denominator This is the correct thing Whatever fraction is terminating That is P by Q So Q will be It would be Some power of Some power of These two prime numbers Two or five Some power of two or five For example You can remove all the terminating decimals Now they say Phase 27 This is the number So how do you solve this? Tell me What can be written when you remove this decimals? You divide it from 1000 You divide it from 1000 You divide it from 1000 Because this is the fraction How is the fraction? 4 plus 0.827 What does it mean? You divide it in so many parts In 1000 parts How do you know? This is the 0.827 So you divide it in 1000 parts And how many parts is it? 0.827 This means If you try to write it in the fraction How do you write it? You write it as It is nothing but 872 Divide by 1000 Or you have learnt Directly What is the difference? Like children They do it No number 4.822 You divide it by 2.0 And you divide it by 2.0 Which is the number What is the difference? It is related to the fraction What is the difference? What is the number in 1000 parts? This is 827 parts Out of 1000 parts So you can write 10k power And 10k power 2 and 5 combination I mean I don't want to give you any number And then P by Q Is a number And this is Q Any power of 2 or 5 Like a number You are telling me This is a point 872 This prime number is divided by 4 4 is divided What is this power of 2? This will always terminate Or you divide it by 79 25 5 سے, یہ ہمے شک دесیمل کیا کر جائے گا, Terminate کر جائے گا, Repeat نہیں کرے گا, Repeating decimals konsey hoot hai, Non-terminating, These are non-terminating, Repeating decimals numbers will have some prime apart from 2 or 5 in the denominator. 10 x 6, Now who is involved in this? 2, But this prime is 3, What will we do? Repeat Let's solve it. So it becomes 1, So 4 has been saved, 4 0, 6 times 36, 4 0, 6 6 6 6 6 6, Because it has 2 or 3, If you divide it by 2, Because it has power of 3, So what will we do? Repeat the decimals. So if you have seen any 3 or 7 in the denominator, What will you do? What will you do? Repeat the fraction of this, What will you repeat? If you have 2 or 5, If you have 2 or 5, What will you do? Terminate These are 2 important things you have to remember about the rational numbers. If you have a terminating decimals, You will have a repeating decimals. And non-terminating non-repeating in case of irrational. Now let's move on to the examples. If you have a number in your party, We are asking you, What is the answer? 4.3333333, In this fraction, in P by Q form, So this is the concept that you are repeating decimals, repeating numbers, Decimal numbers, Convert, Convert in which? In P by Q form, Because you can see one thing, This number 464646, You can approximate it. This is infinite, This will never stop. So if I want to multiply it from a number, I want to multiply it from 19 to 90. So the answer is, I will always get approximate, You think, It would be approximate value, Because this is never stopped. So I can automatically calculate the correct answer. When you think, This is a rational number, This is also a rational number. If you multiply it, What will be irrational? If you will not be rational, Then I want its value. Where will you get the value? So I have to convert this number into P by Q form, Where I can answer it directly. What will be the exact value? That is why I have to learn to change the correct answer in P by Q form. In fact, Cat is tested on this topic. The cat has asked me to change the answer in P by Q form. Now I will give you an idea, First of all, You will convert it, I am teaching you, Remember this thing with you, I will give you the next question, You will have to do it. What is the idea? I have given you a number, I have given you 17.464646. You write it in the other way, and it is 17.46. I will put this out again, What does it mean? This 46 is repeating, after decimal, this whole part 46, this is repeating 46. Now I have to take this number into P by Q form, which means I need to get rid of all these values after decimal point. This decimal point is the value of this value, I have to remove them. If I need to get rid of these values, then what will happen to me? Think about it yourself. This number means I will minus this number, and I will take this number, and I will take this number, and I will delete it. If I need to do this, then think about this number, I can make this form. What can I do? If I multiply this number by 100, I multiply this number by 100. Let's multiply this number by 100. So you get 100 and because it was N, I multiply it by 100. So what will happen to you 100 and N? First of all, you should know, if you multiply this number 464646, how many power do you multiply by 10 power 2 or 100? What does this mean? This decimal point will be shifted by 2 units, after 2 numbers, if you multiply it with 100. If you multiply it by 100, then it will come out of 46. This decimal will come out of here and it will come out of here. So how will you see this number? 1746. Right? 0.464646. Now think what happened to my manipulation? Because this is my manipulation, so that my number becomes the same after the decimal. Because these are infinite values. So I will not be able to take one packet out. How will I take one packet out? By multiplying 100, this is the manipulation. Remember this. Otherwise, I will never be able to read the short tricks. So what I did was multiply it by 100, so I get 46 with 17. Now tell me, what I do in this number? First equation is minus the bottom. So I get 100 minus 1 is 99 N. And it is equal to 71746 minus 17. Because this is the last part. This will be deleted by itself. This number, my 1746. 46464646 and so on. I have done what I did in this number. 464646. Now see, if I subtract it, then this becomes 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. And what is here? I have to do 17 minus 17. Tell me how much will it come? 1746. 16, so 31 or 29. So 1729. It is equal to 99 N. So I get the value of N as 1729 divided by 99. Now if this fraction can be more short, if it can be divided by 3 to 9, then we will make it more difficult. But what is the form of P by Q? You got this form. Correct? Did you see that it was done? It is basic funder. What I have to do? I have to remember one thing. After this decimal, this repeating count is to multiply this number from 10 to 10. This repeating part is the same. Let's do one more question. Let me do this. Let's try it all. Let's solve this question. As I told you, what you have to do is change in P by Q form. Change in P by Q form. I had told you in the first class, don't expect all the questions. I will answer them all. You will have to remove them. I will give you basic things and you will reach the answer. Okay, Zidhanth. Okay, Zidhanth. Okay, try it. Who is answering quickly? What is the answer? It does not matter. You have to learn this concept. You have to remove the answer from your hand. That's it. Here, there is no race here. It is a very good answer. Very good. Thank you. I have taught you a little. I have taken a lot of questions. I am expecting you all. You have changed your mind. It is okay. It is okay. It is okay. That does not matter. What are you doing in the intent? Where are you reaching? I have told you that you are not keeping the memories. I am telling you the truth. If you are keeping the memories, you will be able to talk. What do you need to do in the last slide? I have a number. I have 17.464646. I have understood this example. I need you to solve all other examples. I will change it a little. I will not change the basic idea. I have to multiply this number with some power of 10. I have to do this. I need to repeat this number in the middle of the number. This is the only manipulation. Let's do it. See. My number is 0.496266. I have to repeat this number. I have to repeat this number. I have to repeat this number. I have to repeat this number. I have to repeat this number. I have to repeat this number first. This number is 0.4962626262626262626262626262626. What do you do? I have learnt that when a decimal point is around 6.2. I have to solve this question in the decimal point. کیа کرنایا. Pelleth is decimal point کو hierápil e kyaom. So I have to multiply it with vatao kunal kisya multiply kya roo ke decimal point mera aia lakja repeating decimal so palley. Yes. 100. 100 sem multiply kya roo very good. Mene is ko 100 n karr bhiya. So I get 49 point 6262626262626. And so on. Aber agar me abhi sko minus karnalaka. Mene ni kya diya yepe minus karr loo. Isko minus karnalaka to yaar ko jada haasil liyo oga merpas kyo. Kyao ki ye problem dega 49 joo tha. Lekin abhi meis number ko separateli deko yai ko moje moje mili yaa. To ye pichli question jea sa banalia mei. Kya sa. Point ke baad hi hape repeat karr radi jits. Abuk kya manipulation use karr loo. Then again I have to make this number Jaha hape point ke baad hi faerse 62626262626262 ho. Abuk kya sa banalasak to hoo batau. Is number ko. Now I have to make this number as point 626262. Again I have to multiply with. Kya sa. 100. 100. 100. 100. 100. Very good. Isko 100. 100 se or multiply karr moe kya. Kya kya ye decimal point poje hiha le jaan ais baar. To ye ban gya 100 and 001. To ye 10 ki paas toog aar tha toog aar aag hai to 4 paas oge. To ye number aag hai 4962. Abuk kya karr na aya apne. Isko minus karr loo. To 10000 minus 100. Kya na aya 9900 nt. Aar it is equal to 4962 minus 49. Karr loo. N ki value ka aagye ki. By 69 me se ye minus karr na aapne. Kya karr loo. Nko jese bhi karr tu aap 62 me se 50 minus karr dhi ya. So you get 12. Zada minus karr dhi ya ae kaad karr tu. So you get 13. Divide by 990. Is that clear? Let's move on to the next one. Isko karr kye batau aa fataxe apto answer sab kya aane chai ye. Chau ae jaldi se isko karr kye batau. An sir na. Pura exactly madnikala. Minas kare kye bhi pati nne kala kye chale kye. May calculation ni karr wana chaaar aapse. It's ok. Idea bha saap ko aagye kye se karr na hai. I'm hoping ye sol wo jae kaapse. Aadhing kaap kaalculations karr hai ho. Right? Aaas. Nnmur buda aayu suha ki usko sol naigar na hai. May na hai. Kye aapse idea yes yes. Parul very good haap na nikali ni kaha lhi dhi ya. So kye oke oke. Saap very big number na. Kye aagar na hai. Sabse pale de ko vahifir se idea aapna identifai garo. Kaha se numbers repeat kare. So 28279. 279. 279. These are a digital repeating. Sabse pale decimal point ae kaane hai. Sukai se multiplai gaar nae padeg haap 10 ki power 3 any 1000 n. You get 1000 10 1000 ns 2796 484.279. 279. Oh sorry 279. Point ae ka point aas. Aad ka agar nae aap ko firse. Ye number aap pale stage. Yogi aapse jo. Aapme example me na sikha hai. Now i have to take this 279 in front of this decimal number. Matlab 10 raised to the power 3. Saa firse multiplai garoonga. So 123456 power zahe ge. And i get 2796484279. 279. 279. 279. Nani nikal nae aala ye kyaar ae kaa nae nambar aapka kaa nbi lega aap ko 279. 26484279 minus this value. This value 2796484 and divide by 10. Ye ka hai 10 raised to the power 6. Right minus 1000. Yeni aapne 1 0. Yeni aapke pyece 1 2 3 3 0 to lagi gae. Firu ske paat saare kaa ao jai ge. Nani ns mi convert o jai ge. So it become 9. Ike fir yaha pye kiya raja ae ka. Iye b9 raja ae ka. Iye b9 raja ae ka. Right ae nambar aapko nbi lega. Triple 9 triple 0. This is the number. So is that clear? Sabka ye ya na? Guess yes good. Aapko basic manipulation aabe bhas. Simple. Nao this is a real cat question. Cat 2000 me poch hao hai. Let's try this question. Am ae e try kar one aa chao to aap saa. It's a real cat question. Cat question ais baat ka boch haada wo mat banali aakar na yaar. Ke bhai bhao hai kaat to. Deh ko jara ka. Aabe ju padha ae amne aajin. Let's see this question. Ktaagl kar baare ae nae kar baare ae. I hope sab ye connect kar baare ae rekaring is exactly same as repeating. Repeating decimal. Pew. Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth Siddharth A A i guess i should ask a little bit about the other person Integer yes yes yes indeed because you cancel it what will you cancel it? let's see two times six and what will it take? eight times 28 is written 84 by 3 so this is integer so what else do we have to remember? that p by q has to be in the reduced form whenever you are talking about rational then why is p by q in the reduced form? because 84 by 3 is integer it is not fraction it is fraction that you cannot divide it fraction means after decimals there is a number if you divide it this number will be 28.00 what is this? it is integer so where do you have to be in the first place? I will ask you in the first place so this is the broad classification of rational numbers integers and fractions now further classification is integers what is integers and further classification? I have seen fractions fraction and integers now let me tell you more about integers what integers are classified as because we have plotted the number line all integers integers include this 0, antis and positive integers so integers have two different classifications first classifications are integers what you will do? positive negative positive negative positive negative numbers and second classifications are even numbers or odd numbers and odd numbers one classifications can be integer correct this is about this tree integers and further how you can get positive numbers positive numbers 0, right side of the tree numbers are positive numbers so what is the negative? 0, left side of the tree is integers these are negative integers 0 is neither positive nor negative so remember as I am doing the classifications integers are negative and positive integers here I need to write more these are not just three positive, negative and 0 and 0 so integers are further divided into positive integers negative integers and 0 0 is neither 0 is neither positive nor negative nor negative but why didn't I write in the order? because 0 is an even number 0 is an even number and odd and now we will find out what is the integers positive and negative? so we are going to study this number for the numbers of the main which we have to study these are natural whole prime numbers which are the positive numbers these are the positive numbers these are useful numbers counting numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 so what is the further classification of positive numbers? the positive numbers if you talk about the classification and what is the next thing to talk about? what are the positive numbers? natural numbers natural numbers these are natural numbers and if you include 0 with natural numbers then what are the numbers? these are whole numbers these are the numbers we are writing what are the natural numbers so in the second cat perspective we will use the link look natural numbers are set of all positive integers I will use this definition for natural numbers what is natural numbers? 1,2,3, these are all positive because when I say non-negative integers non-negative means just this is not the case these integers are included in non-negative so all numbers are non-negative integers non-negative integers and natural numbers are positive integers positive integers even numbers definition set of integral multiples of 2 even what is the meaning? 2k multiples will be the same and these numbers can be divided these are known as even numbers they will represent 2 n's because these two can be divided by 2k multiples and the two numbers will be divided by 2k or even the other two numbers what is the meaning? odd numbers or 2 to divide 2 n plus 1 or 1 to the remainder of the remainder are odd numbers all of them will be given by the positive integers in fact the whole chapter is based on natural numbers because the same numbers are left because the biggest part is going to be read so natural numbers will be the same but this classification is very important in fact even odd properties what are even what are odd multiples what are even what are odd multiples but this is just a terminal which you just have to know next, we will explain it again but I think time is over let's keep on here next class we will cover it we will cover it a little slower I was thinking of it let's cover it a little more but let's see I don't want to cry today because I haven't seen it in the next class so even odd numbers will be read again it's a very interesting thing we will also solve the question and we will be able to solve it and we will be able to solve it when we reach the prime numbers then the factor factorial will be the number theory you have to know you have to know the numbers and the number theory will be the same and the number theory will be the same I promise you if you do the same thing then there will be no question about the number system you will have to handle all the things in the number system but you have to solve all the things and you have to solve all the problems so let's keep on today's class we will cover it in the next class from here odd numbers, even numbers and further classification so now you will not get any SwapNil PDF this class is a recorded session as you have become number class then you will get a recorded video on the portal you can see the difference and you can see the difference so from this so now I won't upload the sheet for this class because there are no questions but after the second class I will upload a sheet then what will happen then you will get a home sheet like the depth of the class then you will get a home sheet and then you have to solve the problems because now you are looking at the class and it looks good that the class is great I understood everything wherever you are going to do the problems and remember the teacher you are writing your pens and you are not understanding the teacher you are not understanding the math you will be able to solve the problems you will be able to practice so let's see next class next class I think it is a person you will be a class I don't know but to match the class then it will be a person so today it will be the 18th so it will be our next class so from here we will continue I want to keep a class so that it will be a good class and we will be able to get a good class I hope you guys have enjoyed now go and do it yes we have to talk to someone we have to ask ask from here it is okay Kunal, very welcome my purpose is you will not be able to understand until you leave the class you should be careful you should be careful whatever you want to talk and stopping the recording
