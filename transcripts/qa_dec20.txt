 So classification of numbers, you were talking about numbers. So there are two broad categories, the first category is called real and imaginary numbers. When we created real numbers, then it was rational and irrational. Then we see rational numbers, rational numbers, which we can represent in P by Q, Q is not equal to 0 and PQ belong to some integers. So rational numbers, we saw the definition of rational numbers, which were determined after decimal point, or the repeats. Irrational definition was defined as such numbers. We repeat this and that is not the termination. Non-repeating and non-terminating numbers. These are irrational numbers. For example, the root 7, the root 22, root 3, PIE, PIE, all the constants. Rational numbers, further we can divide into complete and incomplete numbers. Inteasures, integers, where P by Q represent the form and Q is equal to 1. Apart from integer, there are fractions, which are incomplete numbers. They represent the fractions. So, the number can represent the form and Q is not equal to 1. These are known as fractions. So, further classify fractions. Let's see, what is part of integers? So, integers have different different classifications. Their first classification is integers. We can have positive, negative and 0. So, what is this number? Negative numbers, 0 and positive numbers. So, we are making positive numbers. I am making number 3. I am making all the things easy to understand. Positive, positive numbers. What do we say? These are known as natural numbers. Normal counting numbers. When you are non-negative, you are not going to leave the negative numbers. You have included 0. Positive numbers are known as whole numbers. These are known as whole numbers. Whole numbers are gone. And these are negative numbers. So, 0 is neither positive nor negative. So, integers have different classifications. How else? Positive, 0 and negative numbers can divide all the numbers into complete numbers. So, what else can we say? Even and odd numbers. So, what is the odd numbers and even numbers? This is the second classification. What is the even order? Even numbers, which are multiple, integral multiples of 2. This is the definition. So, these numbers, which you can divide by 2. These are known as even numbers. The number of 2N form, which is even number. How are the odd numbers? You cannot divide them by 2. And these are odd numbers, which are the numbers of 2N plus form. So, this is the classification. Now, look at this. This is the integer classification of positive and negative 0. This is our exhaustive. All the complete numbers are inside this classification. You can say this more. Also, even odd numbers are coming in the same order. Mind you, 0 is even number. What do you consider 0? Because it is divisible by 2. 0 is divisible by every number. So, it is even number. Even odd numbers can divide all the numbers. So, till here, these other terminal logies were saved. You can also say that set of integers, which leaves a remainder of 1 upon division by 2. So, now, the numbers, for example, we are talking about integers. So, I am talking about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This is the number of these. So, look at this. If you divide it by 2, the idea of a single column is the remainder of the 2. When you divide it by 1, what do you get? 1. 2 says, divide it by 2 and 0. So, you say, it is completely divisible by 2, which means it is an even number. What is this order number? So, you see, every consecutive number even or odd is the same. If you take consecutive numbers, or I say that no one in the world has any number. So, if you take two consecutive numbers, then one will be even and one will be odd. It is definite. Because they are occurs alternately. Like, if there is a 3, then you will divide it by 2. So, you will get remainder as 1, 4 remainder 0, 5 remainder 1, 6 remainder 0 and so on. So, this is exhaustive list. Even in an odd classification, all the complete numbers are coming. If I say integers, then these are complete numbers. And fractions are incomplete numbers. You will know the fractions. You will also see first. 1 by 4 is a fraction, 2 by 3 is a fraction, 9 by 2 is a fraction. This form is different. If you write in decimal terms, then how do you write? 9 by 2 is equivalent to 4.5. How is this? So, this is whole classification of numbers. Now, let's talk about each of them, 1 by 1. First of all, important is even odd numbers. If you have any questions, then you should know that they have some property. So, if you do an arithmetic operation, even numbers, odd numbers, or both of them in combination. What are their properties? Let's talk about them. So, first is addition. Even if you do addition to even number, then you will always get the even number. This is very obvious. You can check your copy yourself. Right? So, for this test, I will give you a tip. I will test it from my side. For example, it is not advisable that you learn these. But these are like formulas. Even plus even. Now, try to do it. Take any example. What is the number in your brain? 2. What will be 2 plus 2? 4. 4. 6 plus 2. 8. 8. Again, even. Right? And what can you do? You can assume even number. 0. What? You can assume odd number. 1. Okay? And if you want to do more number, then you should always try it. Okay. Even plus even. Let's go to see. Let's see the property once. Even means 0. Even means 0. What will be 0? You will get 0. Again, that is even. Right? Now, let's talk about even and even. Same, same. So, you will always get. What will be in addition? If numbers are same. If you are adding the same. So, you get even always. In terms of addition. You will add odd plus. For example, odd is 1. Then 1 and 1 adds up to 2. What is 2? Even. So, these two things are understood. And then, if you have this combination. Even plus odd. So, I will always get an odd number. How? Even is 0. Odd is 1. And 1 plus 0 is always 1, which is odd. So, in this way, you will remember. In fact, you can take any odd number from your side. The idea is, one thing you have to do in your mind. That you will talk about the counting numbers. You can classify them even or odd. In fact, even odd means 2n or 2n plus 1. We will talk about a little later. That 2 is a special number. Why not 3, 4, 5, 6, 7? So, there is no special number. But, there is no name of even odd. However, you can represent every natural number in terms of families of numbers. I will introduce you to the idea of the future. I will give you a number of families. What are the families? But, here 2 is not special. We can use any number. So, let's talk about the multiplication of the property. You know, no number is even. What does even mean? It is 2k multiple. 2n means 2k multiple. So, 1, 2 multiply is something. What does multiple mean? I will say 2k multiple, 3k multiple. What are multiples? For example, if you have this number 2. What are multiples? What will be multiples? What is the number? If you have one, orderly, which we read in the classifications of numbers. If you multiply the positional values in the order, the tables are going to be multiplied. So, that are multiples of 2. For example, 2 into 1 is 2. 2 into 2 is 4. 2 into 3 is 6. 2 into 4 is 8. So, these are multiples of 2. This is the first multiple. Second multiple, third multiple and fourth multiple of 2. So, 2n means any number which is multiple of 2. If you think about this, if you multiply 2n by anything, you will multiply it by any number. So, what do you get? As you multiply it, this 2 will be a lot of vanish. 2 will always remain there. So, 2 into 2, whatever the problem is, whatever it is, but 1, 2 will always remain with it. We have read the multiplication. What does this mean? Even number, this is even, when even is multiplied with anything in this world, will always give me an even result. So, to give an even result, just for one even number, it is enough. At least one even, then you multiply it by anything, for example, even into even. Will give me even number. Even if even is multiplied, it will remain even. If it is a new number, then let's test it. 2 into 1, will 2. 2 into 9, 18. What will we get? Even. But, when two odd numbers are multiplied, you have 1 into 1 is 1. 1 into 3 is 3. This will always give an odd result. So, you have a little help here. If you get two odd numbers, you get two or more odd numbers. So, you can most definitely say, that these numbers are odd. Because even if even is multiplied, what will you give the result? Even number. So, it is not very important. Also, you can drive these results. You can write them on your copy. Just once, you have to tell. Even odd is the arithmetic properties. When you have a multiplication, you have to add them. If I ask you subtraction, subtraction is not visible. What will be even minus even? You can always tell. So, 4 minus even minus even is always 0 minus 0 is 0. Even. If you say, you have to add even in order. What will be? 3 minus 2 is 1. It will always be odd. 9 minus 2 is 7. It is always odd. Even if I add odd minus, so 2 minus 1 is 1. There is no order. It does not matter. But if you add odd minus, I will talk about subtraction. If you add odd minus, what will you get? 3 minus 3 is 0. 9 minus 5 is 4. It will always result in even number. So, you have to remember the addition or subtraction. When same number is same, same will always give you even. Same number is good. Minus or same number is good. It will always give you even. If it is different, we will always give odd. It is such a theory. I will give you a little bit of this question. If you have come to this 5 minutes, then let's solve this question and give me the answer. Thank you. Thank you. I was saying, I need to remember this. The answer is not so important. Which star is going to be confused? It does not matter. It is going to be intent. How do you approach this question? It does matter for me. So, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Some people have answered. Let me give you some hint. Some people are answering. Even but not sure if they are answering. I am going to see. This is X is 3 minus 6. It is going like this. Then you do 9 minus 12. Now you are going to do next. You know positive numbers. 3 plus 6 is 9 plus 6 is 15. Here you can see 3. In the negative sign, 3 is 3 minus 6. Then positive sign is 3 is 9. Next number is minus 18. Then plus 21. And so on. This number is gone. And where is this number? I do not know. But last one was 90. So, what is going to happen before this? This is 3 and 3 less. That is 87. This is going to happen. I do not know anything. I do not know anything. I do not know anything. What can I do? I have to comment about X. No one is asking you about this. How much will this be? No. Just I am asking about X. So, look at this. You can see in the terms of this. 3 minus 6 is 9 minus 12. 15 minus 18. So, every pair is different. It is always minus 13. If you say that 3 and minus 6 are different. Otherwise, the difference is different. This is also minus 13. This is also minus 13. So, you can see that every pair is different. And so on. So, what is the difference between the last pair? Minus 13. If you want to know how many minus 3 is different. So, it will be easy. So, X is equal to nothing but the addition of these minus 3s. So, I just need these minus 3s. I have to find out how many minus 3s are different. So, you can do one thing. I am going to show you this. This is 3. So, 1, 2, 3. So, this is the first packet. It comes on the third one. It starts from the third one. And then, this is the number 9. I am getting this on the third one. How do I get this? I get this on the third one. How many packets can you find? So, 3 into 1, 3 into 2, you get this. You get this on the third one. How do I get this? And this is the number you get. 3 into 1, 29. And this is the number you get. 3 into 3. So, you can tell me how many total terms will be taken? How many total terms will be taken? How many total terms will be taken? 15 terms. How do I say 15? Because I know that if I see this first term, I see this packet, 3 into 1. And then, 3 into 3. And then, 3 into 29. I mean, I have to go. Or, if I see the second term, I will be more comfortable. 3 into 2, 3 into 4. And I am going till 3 into 30. So, 2 of counting. Even numbers. This is the first number. This is the second number. Which number will be the 15th? Why? Because this is 2 into 1, 2 into 2. This is 2 into 15. If I see 30, then I will count. So, where am I going to count? 2 into 1. And then, 2 into 15. There are 15 numbers. This means, this x would be minus 3 into 15. So, this is the number you get. So, what will happen? Now, the value of the x is also clear. It is minus 45. Now, tell me. The answer I gave you. Yes, x. Is it even? No. But not divisible by 4. No, it is not divisible by 4. No, x is odd. Ax is n. Or number. Right? This is odd. Yes, yes. Yes, sir. Yes, yes, sir. The answer is the same. Ax is odd. But, I think I got a shortcut in the mile. Very good. So, it is not that difficult. Yes, sir. I have said that if I see 3, 9 and 15, then it is a pattern. So, it is odd. So, you can do the addition. If all the addition is odd, then it is odd. And the minus 6 minus 6 is even. Yes. So, minus, bracket is even minus even. So, if odd plus odd is odd, minus even. So, it is even odd. So, I did it like this. Very good. This was what I wanted to do. I wanted to do it. I was going. Now, I have explained. I heard what you have done. I am telling you this in one way. But, after this, why did you do this question? Even minus even. Yes, I wanted you to use these properties. Because, it can do every thing. It is not the one who has read it. My benefit is that this is a cat. And, the purpose of this is to show you the slide behind it. Right? How to do this? When you add these numbers, these are odd numbers. And, when you add odd numbers, what will you get? Yes, what was this? These are odd numbers. Yes. When you add odd numbers, what will you get? No, I have. So, I have shown the answer to the wrong. I have shown the order. You have also shown the even. Yes. You have shown the even. Why is the order so easy? You have to tell me the correct order. You have to tell me the correct order. It will definitely be the order. But, why is the order so easy? The face is wrong. I have given it the order. Yes. It is a little wrong. But, I have given the order. You have to tell me the same. What do you say? You only talk about the previous slide. Add odd numbers. Add odd numbers. Add odd will give you even. If I talk about odd plus odd plus odd, what will you give? You will give you even, and what will you give even plus odd? You will give you odd. You will give odd. You will give odd. So, if you get 3 odd, then you will get odd. So, this depends on how many numbers of odd are used here. Now, you can tell them. You can't say that, but I have added them. Now, you have to see how many packets are used. These packets are used, like this, like this. Or, if you have a limit, then you should have 3 into 1 here. Here, 3 into 29 should be used. So, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5 should be used. So, you have to add odd numbers. Or, you have to add 2 to the idea. This is what you have added. You should know that these are positive numbers. These are 15 numbers. And these negative numbers are also 15 numbers. They are equal numbers. They are better to add the negative numbers because they are even. So, you have to identify one thing. In this question, how many odd numbers are there? So, here, 15 odd numbers. And there are 15 even numbers. Now, if you add odd numbers, what will you give? You will always give odd numbers. Right? 15 number of times, if you add it, it will always give you odd. Now, minus, what is the even numbers? So, even plus even, 2 into 4, 4 into 6, what will you give you? Even number. Now, what will you give odd minus even? You have to give odd numbers. So, you can say directly here, without the value of X. But, I hope that, it is clear now. Right? Yes. Yes. Anyone else, anyone else, in this? It can happen. In multiple ways, you can do it in any way. There is a cat in the cat. There is a cat in every exam. You have to find the answer. Just verify it. You think it is correct or not. Because, you think it is very important. If you are thinking wrong, then it can happen. I think, there will be a question wrong. You will see. Right? Let's solve this question now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I am going to get all the answers. I want to answer all this question. Because, all these are understood now. Right? Even odd, in some way, in some way, there is a cat in each exam. But, what is it? XYR integers, if x plus y is odd and x into y is even then which of the following is true Okay, in options, we should check the key, which is right, xy integers and one thing is that x plus y is the integer of these two integers Which is some sort of odd, what are we still getting? Which two things are added and give you odd numbers also, which two numbers give you the product even Right? X plus y is odd and you know that if these two numbers are even or even then we should always have odd numbers Or some a is the same, if one of them is odd and one of them is even then this is the key, also xy is even Right? This is something that xy can be even, then it will be even your product or any number can be even Right? We will always give you even and simultaneously if these two conditions are satisfied, what does it mean? That one number has to be odd and one number has to be mandate really even, in a way that is not even odd Assuming x to be odd and y to be sorry, x to be even, y to be odd, or the other case can be even When x is odd, y is even, in two cases you have to check all these options Let's see, first case, first of all I will check this is even, even into odd, so we will always have odd numbers Even plus, even into odd, even will get, even plus, even what will happen? So what we will do is we will do option number one, no, what do you know, in this second case, it is not true So we will not reach conclusion so soon, so we will think ahead Now I hope we are clear, we can all get out, now all of you have two answers, first we will get out Very good, if we were to check all the options from the beginning, right? Now, this even plus, even is given me even, it is partially true Why? Because I have to check the second option, what is the second case? x, odd, y, even, so let's see, when x is odd and odd into even, odd into even, even will always be given odd plus even, what is your odd? Is it definitely true? No, why? It is true in one case, it is not true in one case, let's see the second option e square, if e is even, then it will be even If y is odd, then odd square is always odd, so this will always be even plus odd If x is odd, then what will happen? Its square will always be odd y is even, even square is even, so what will it also be? odd And it is definitely true for every case, two cases were being made, for both cases, it will always be true The third and fourth cases were checked, x plus y, always what will be the odd? Even odd or even, always what will be the sum in it? odd, odd square will always give you odd and not even So, it is absolutely wrong, 5xy, because x is even, then nothing can happen xy, now multiply the product with any number, what will happen to this even? So, this is also not my answer, correct answer is option 2 I hope it is clear, no one will be able to see it, only one property, x plus y, odd can be used Either x, even, y, odd, x odd, y, even, because x, y is even, when at least one number is even, right? Next, so this is even odd story, whenever you encounter a question, you can handle it Let's talk about fractions now, we read an integer classification of classifications Even odd, we had to know some properties, let's talk about fractions So, I have already given you the definition of fractions, all those numbers, all those real numbers, which can be represented in this form p by q Where p and q are integers and q is not equal to 0, it is very important So, fraction, whenever you have seen this, let's take an example of number, if my number is 2 by 3 Let's take this idea of a number, what is 2 by 3? So, terminal, this number, the number on the line, I say, we all say, this is known as numerator And this is known as denominator If you don't know this, you will see that numerator, denominator, because this will come again and again We will talk about numerators and denominators So, what is the basic sense of fractions? 2 parts out of 3 complete parts, that is, if you divide it in 3 equal parts, you divide it in 3 equal parts So, you divide it in 3 equal parts, you are talking about 2 parts, 1 part, and 2nd part You are talking about 2-3rd of something, so you are comparing 2 things, you are also comparing 2 things And this division is also showing that you are dividing 2 by 3 So, this is fraction, so you are going to see the value of fraction, yes, how do you do it? The value of fraction is divided by the long division method, you divide it in 2, we have learnt it in school Because it cannot be divided, so you put it 0 here and 6 times is 18 So, you subtract it and then it comes 2 and then again 20 is 0.6666 and so on We are learning that when we change the p y in the p y form, then how do we change it? And how do we divide it in the p y in the long division method? Now, let me tell you one more thing about number line And we will show you in number line that where are these fractions? So, this is 0 and here is my 1, here is 2 and this is 3 and so on So, this is minus 1, minus 2 and minus 3 So, fractions there are 2 types of fractions Which one? We have learnt in childhood, we are in proper and improper But let us forget which is improper, improper fractions What is the proper fraction? And improper fraction You will remember it from your name and relate it in this way Proper fraction is that, it is purely fraction, fraction numbers, fractions you understand? 0 point something, it is not complete but incomplete So, the totally incomplete number, that is proper fraction And as a fraction, in which there is something, complete part, within incomplete part, it is known as improper What am I talking about? I will explain once, if I talk about proper fraction So, I am talking about that number which has no complete part, in which there is no complete part And where will they take the numbers? Tell me, proper fraction If I ask you where will they get this number line? Tell me But you have to understand, there is no complete part in proper fractions So, yes, paru, paru is saying 0 to 1, here the number you will get, for example, this is 0 point 25 If there is a number here, 0 point 8, here 0 point 5 If you do this in fractions, this is 1 by 4, 1 by 2 And this is 4 by 5, in this way So, these fractions, these are 0 to 1, in which there is no complete part, these are incomplete parts You say these numbers, proper fractions These are proper fractions So, even after 1, there is a fraction, for example, this is half of them, just what will happen? 3 by 2 And 1 point 5 Here, there is no number here, 1 point 25 Here, there is no number here, 1 point 75 And this number is also existing And if you look at one thing, you can see that if I am talking about 1 point 75 So, this is the incomplete part And this is complete part That there is no complete part, how much incomplete part or added a mere number So, this is complete plus a small part, incomplete So, these are improper fractions These numbers, these are improper fractions So, the number is existing here and there So, only 0 to 1, no minus 1 to 0, you will get the number What will happen? It would be minus 0 point 25 Here, minus 0 point 5 will be available So, this is all incomplete, there is no complete part added It will be complete, when you have numbers like 1 minus 1 point 5 minus 2 point 3 These are incomplete So, minus 1 to small and 1 to the big These numbers are improper fractions If I am definition wise, write that 1 to the big, all fractions are improper minus 1 to the small, all fractions are improper So, where will you get the proper fractions from where you get the number 1 to the big, minus 1 to the big, all fractions are improper fractions 1 second, I will erase this 1 to the big, minus 1 to the big, all fractions are improper fractions So, if you want to write the definition, then you have to see one thing 1 by 4, 1 by 2, 4 by 5 Numerator is always, or I am saying proper fraction If it is represented as P by Q, then P is always less than Q P by Q, proper fraction is the denominator bigger than numerator If you talk about improper fraction, numerator is bigger than denominator If P by Q is improper, then what you will say here P is always greater than Q Then this is a complete part added So, these are proper and improper If I am talking about the range, here I want to write proper fractions Where will you get 1 to the big, minus 1? Improper fractions less than minus 1 and fractions greater than 1 to the big, right? Now, if I write this number like 3 by 2 How else can I write it? Because I know if I divide this number then I get one complete part and some incomplete part and that is 1 by 2. This form of fraction is known as mixed fraction. Fraction was not a type of fraction but it was said that if I write this proper fraction it is not a proper fraction. It is written in this way and it is said to be mixed. Because I am mixing complete and incomplete parts. So by definition you can write 1 by 2 as well. Now we will see the fraction. What is the operation? So write this mix part as equal to 1 by 2. Because if you add these two numbers you get 3 by 2. It is possible that someone is having problems. Now I am going to the next slide. I will talk about the operations of fractions. So it is possible that someone is looking at it. Please do your work on it. Because in fractions, add and subtraction multiplication is written in division. Then it is going to be written in the next slide. I have given all these definitions. The numerator is less than denominator. It is proper. The numerator is more than denominator. Okay. This is what is being said. Mixed fraction, improper fraction expressed as a combination of an integer and proper fraction. Correct? What are the equivalent fractions? Just know the definition. The fractions are the same. When I talked about comparison. So I was talking about the ratio. The ratios that we will read, we will connect to the terms. The one by two is the fraction in the reduced form. What if I multiply numerator and denominator both by two? So I would get 2 by 4. This fraction is also equal to the number of fractions. Because you can easily cancel this two out of numerator and denominator. So it will remain the same one by two. So these two fractions are equal. So what will you call these equivalent fractions? Yes. Lots are infinite. You can write 3 by 6 is also 1 by 2. 4 by 8 is also 1 by 2. In fact, if you look at 21 upon 42, it is also 1 by 2. And so on. So equivalent fractions say that the number of fractions of the fraction when the numerator and denominator are interchange. For example, if it is half and I will tell you that write the number of the number of the fraction. So how will you write the number of the number of the fraction? 2 by 1. What is the numerator? It goes down, denominator goes up. Just flip it. And one more test is that this is reciprocal. If you multiply it with a number of the number of the fraction, you would get 1. So what is the reciprocal? Just rule. The fraction of the numerator goes in the place of denominator and denominator goes in the place of numerator. So let's talk about some operations on fractions. Additions of fractions. I want you to add 2 by 3 plus 4 by 7. Okay. What is the answer to this? You have to add and tell us. How to add? I will tell you once. You have to see how to add these numbers. But these two numbers have to be added. Okay. The idea is that you have to see one thing. The idea is that I have to add these two parts 2 by 3 plus 4 by 2. These two are the proper fractions. I have to add them. So see what I am going to do. Forget about that. If you learn something in childhood, you have to multiply this number here, multiply this number and multiply them below. What is the idea? I am telling you. Okay. When you will add these two fractions, what is the basic idea? You have to add fractions. You have to learn this. If you learn 2 plus 4, I can write this in 6. I have a simple addition. I don't know if you can ask me. We can do this again. Do one thing. Reduce the fractions and integers. Reduce the integer form. If I reduce the integer form, what will I do? I have to make this integer 2 by 3. I have also done a question. What do I multiply it? If I want to make this integer 2 by 3, I need this 3 to be completely... ...vynished. I should have done 3. I mean multiply this number from this number. What is the value of this fraction? What is the value of the third? What is the value of the third? Why not? I will multiply it from the same number. I will multiply the second number. I have to multiply this whole expression. I have to multiply this whole expression. I have to see the second number on the denominator. I have to see that the second number is also a multiple. My second number is a seven cancel. I will do this. I will multiply these two numbers with a common multiple. I mean I have to multiply this whole number with a common multiple. But think about my family. I have to multiply this number with a methodical result. I have two numbers, a plus and a plus. What I have done is, I have multiplied this number with a three and a two. This number is increased by three and a two. It has become so many times. What I have done is, I have divided this number with a single number. If I multiply this number with a single number, I will divide it with a number of twenty. Let's see what happens. I have divided this number with a three and a two. Now see what happens with this whole expression. This number will be multiplied with the first number. Let's see what happens. 3 and a two divided by three and a two. This three has canceled this number. What happens with this number is, 7 into 2. That is, 14 divided by 3 into 7. This number is multiplied by another number. Which is nothing but 3 into 7, 4 by 7. 3 into 7 was already 7. 7 cancels is 4 into 3. You got 12 upon 3 into 7. Now you can see that, in numbers, or we will do one thing. It will be a little complicated. You can make an integer from this. Let it remain outside. I have divided this number by leaving it outside. Right. How did you get the numbers? Here, number 1 upon 3 into 7 multiplied by 1. You got 14 plus 12 and multiplied by this expression. What happened with this expression? 26 divided by 3 into 7. And you got 26 upon 21. This is the basic idea. Now I will reduce this. For my help, what do I do every time? Now you will understand that when you add 2 by 3 and 4 by 7, then you write Lcm here. Why do you write Lcm in multiple numbers? This is what happens. Ultimately, the process is that these 2 numbers multiply by such numbers that the denominator cancels. Then write that number. It is easy to add integers. That is why, what do you do in addition of fractions? This denominator is called Lcm. You get the lowest common multiple. 7 or 3. Because these are 2 prime numbers. Lcm would be 7 into 3. Then what do you do? Divide this number by 21. So 7 times. You multiply 7 times by 2. It is 14 plus 7. Then divide this number by 3 times and multiply it by 4. So what is the fraction of this number? 26 upon 21. Correct. So this is the whole process. Now multiply this number by 7 into 4 into 4. Because where I did not take this number, I will show you the starting number. 2 by 3. And you have 1. 4 by 4. Or write 5 upon 6. Now look. 6, 2, 3, 5. So what is the lowest common multiple? 2 numbers 6. And not product. 18 is the lowest multiple is 6. If it is 6, 3 by 2. 2 times 2 into 2 is 4. This is the multiply. 1 times 1 plus 5 is 5. So 5 of 4 is 9 upon 6. This is the answer. This is the denominator of Lcm. And write this addition. Add fractions. No one is ashamed. If you are in a personal life, then please go back to NCRT. In NCRT, practice this. Because this is not the work of studying. It is basic idea. How is the addition? Do you understand? The same way, you subtract fractions. If it is 4 upon 7 minus 3 upon 4, then how will you do it? It is... What is the question? What is the question? It is the same answer. But even if here we cross multiply, it is the same answer. Yes, because then... See, you don't have to confuse two things. I want to tell you. You wrote 6 and 3 of Lcm. 6. And here we multiply. This is the answer. I am saying this. 6 into 12. 12 or 3 into 5 is 15. 12 plus 15 is not 15. Then you do this. 3 into 6. Take it. Do this too. Because you cancel these three ultimately. 4 plus 5 is 9 upon 6. So, for cross multiply, that is why I don't do that. What is the idea? Let's talk about subtraction. Again, the same. What is the value of Lcm? 7, 4, what? 28? 4, 4, 16 minus 4, 7 into 3 is 21. How much is it? 5 upon 28. Good. Let's talk about multiplication. If you multiply 4 by 7, then 3 by 4. What happens? Simple. Multiply. The numerator will multiply. And the denominator will multiply. If you cancel, you cancel it. 3 by 7. The most important thing is that it is divided into divisions. What do we do in divisions? Look at this. As you see, the fraction is A by B. I have to divide it by C by D. So, what will the answer be? Let's see. Let's see. What is A by B? Simple example. 4 by 3. It has to be divided by 3 by 4, 3 by 7. Let's do this. Let's divide it by 2 by 7. Let's divide it. So, divide the actual divide. If you have calculated this, then don't multiply it by multiplying it. Simple. It was a term of 4 by 3. Treat it as a single term. It has to be divided by division. What is the division? You divide it by 2 by 7. Now, look at this. This is the division of fractions. What does it mean? 4 by 3 is 2 by 7. Let's divide it. Now, if you want to solve this, then how will it happen? 4 by 3. You will have to write it in one term. If you simplify this expression and write it in one term. Because you know, this is a numerator. This is a denominator. You just have to do this in fraction. You have to do this in one term. And what is the division of fractions? You have to find this number. Where this numerator is, and this denominator is. So, when you divide it in fraction, where will you go? First of all, in denominator. So, 4 by 3. Which means, the division of fractions is here. This is the multiplication. If I make a whole line in these two numbers. So, it has to be 2 by 7. In this way. This way is going to happen. Now, this 2 by 7, it goes to in place of numerator. This 2 by 7, I mean, 4 by 3. It goes here and it flips. It reaches up. Because ultimately, you have to write in denominator in two things. Okay. Once again, I think, what is the idea? Because it has to be divided. One second. Because it has to be divided. This is 4 by 3. If it is divided, then it will have to be 7 by 2. If it is remembered, then it is good. Otherwise, A by B, A by B, I will divide it by C by D. Okay. So, what I will do? A by B, I wrote it first. Now, D, it cannot be down. So, where it will reach up? So, it becomes A D upon B C. Okay. There are some examples on the next screen. So, you solve it. These three expressions will be clear to you. Tell me quickly. 1 upon y. I remember it from the beginning. You have to remember y upon z and z upon x. Tell me the answers. Okay. What? What? Okay. I will write it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

number inside these two brackets or inside these two sticks is negative. When x value mod in the mod, the value of the value is negative. So this will open as a minus x when x mod x is positive. So this will open with plus x. I don't know anything about this. I don't know anything about this. I just need to define the mod x in this way. Now I will ask you something. Just remember this. I told you this is the absolute value. I told you this is the absolute value. Okay, let's see. I will tell you the 2 point mod 2, minus 3, minus 4.5, minus 4.5, minus 5. Now I will ask you a little difficult. I will write their value in the form of a vertex. I will ask you 2 minus 3. Okay, I have added more things inside. I will tell you 5 minus 3. I will tell you the value of the mod. What will happen? 2 value, simple 2, 3 value, absolute value. I will tell you the absolute value. I will only get the sign. 4.5, sign is negative. It will open with negative. 4.5, 5 will come. Okay, now this is 2 minus 3. First I have to solve the mod. So I saw 2 minus 3 in the mod. 1 minus 1 means absolute value is 1. Okay, 5 minus 2. First I have to write 2 in the mod. This is 2. Right? Everything is clear. Everything has the right answer. Yes, correct. This is about mod. You do this operation on the number, on the variable. How it opens? If the mod is positive, it will open like x. Negative is minus x. You have to remember it. Now I will do this in this question. How many integral values of x satisfy this thing? I am not talking about algebra yet. If algebra is studied, then it will be very deep. But now, you have to handle some questions. You know what is the mod? Now this expression is asking you, that mod x minus 2 is quantity. It is less than 4. So tell me, which value of x is the value of x? The first answer is, let me tell you. You have to think about this inequality. You have just thought that this is number. x minus 2 is something else. You should think about the value of x. If I say this, this means, the value of x is greater than this value. What you will say, if this is a, this is less than. This is not the sign of the value of x. And what is this? A or B? This is greater than B. This will be the idea. Let's talk about this. That x minus 2 is something else. It is less than 4. What does it mean? We should also think about this. How many integral values of x satisfy? How many integral values? That means, x can't be 2.5, how many values can we get? 1 is possible. 2, 3, 4 is the value of this way. Integral values. Integral values. Integral values. Integral values. Integral values. Integral values. Integral values. I have a very important thing to tell you. Number line. Whenever something happens, always check less than, even if you want to check, just make number line. It will be easy to live. Everything is tough. You don't make this line. I am giving you hints. Make this number line. Check the values there. What? This is the value of x. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. And here minus 1, minus 2, minus 3, minus 4, minus 5, and minus 6. Now check it out. All of you. You will get a value of x. What will you get from the values? Will you get a value of less than 4? This is the mod. Tell me. I will give you more hints. I have to check one value. Let's see. I have put x in it. I have put x in it. I have put x in it. Let's see. What will happen to my expression? It will become mod of 6 minus 2. So what will happen to 6 minus 2? 4 is 4 less than 4. No 4 is equal to 4. This means that x is not going to come in 6. Why? Because x equal to 6 is the value of 4. And the values of 4 should be below. So, one thing is clear. When x equal to 6, I will give this mod 4. I will not give the value of x. This means that x can take some values below. 5 can take. If I check the value of x, I will check minus 5. Or x has another value. I have put x equal to minus 7. I have given x to minus 7. Let's see minus 7 minus 2. Think of negative number. But mod is on this number. What will happen? It is minus 9. What is minus 9? What is absolute value? So, what is 9? No 4 is equal to 9. No 4 is equal to x minus 7. And if I add minus 7 to the small value, it goes into negative minus 8 minus 9. So, how will this expression go up to 4? So, see this expression. Now we will generalize it. Yes. Many of you are saying minus 1 to 3. That's what I am saying. Let's see. Let's check. So, the very big expression. I have shown you the intent to reach the answer. I have just told you that you have to check the number line. So, x minus 2. When x is 5, I will write the value of x minus 2 here. What will happen? 2 is 3. It is 3 less than 4. Yes. It is acceptable. 4 minus 2 is 2. 3 minus 2 is 1. 2 minus 2 is 0. 4 is small. 1 is small. 1 is small. 1 is small. 1 is small. 1 is small. 2 is small. 4 is 4. 4 less than 4. Yes. 5 to 5. This expression. How do you remember it? Let me generalize it a little. If mod of a is less than. If mod of a is less than. This value is less than. Greater than minus. If I am saying that mod is small. What do you say? Let me tell you that this is a belongs to minus k2. 1 should be minus k. Simple. I can handle it like this. If mod of x minus 2 is less than 4. What do you say? x minus 2 is this expression. x minus 4. Now you can handle it. If you have a little idea of this. No. We will not do it. We will not use the number line. This is about mod. You are thinking about this. What did you say? You have not read the mod. How do you ask the question of mod? Second thing is factorial. If you have seen some people. Factorial is simple operation. What is factorial? You will encounter some questions. I will write a mark on the 2nd. I will write a mark on the 2nd. What will I say? This is 2 factorial. Modular is also a definition. What is the definition? Factorial is nothing but the product of numbers. If I talk to you. N factorial. N factorial is defined in a way. Product of all the numbers. Which are less than or equal to n. If I say 2 factorial. How will the 2 factorial be defined? This is 2. This is 2. 2 is important. The number of numbers is the product of the 2nd. We will write 2 into 1. This is nothing but 2. If I talk to you. Let me tell you 5 factorial. What is the 5 factorial? How will you give the number? How will you read it? 5 factorial. How will you read it? 1. How will you read it? 5 factorial. 5 into 4. 20. 20. 20. 16. 120. This is about factorial. Let me write a number of factorial. 7 factorial. Let me write it in a way. Let me write it in a way. 1. This is the product of the natural numbers. Where is the natural numbers? The factorial is going to be. 4, 5, 6 and 7. If you use the correct value of a factorial. 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1. 5 factorial. You can write it like this. 5 factorial. 5 into 2 into 7. This means you write it like this. 120 into 42. Or the first 6 multiply. Then multiply it with 7. 6 into 120. 720 into 7. How much is 5 0 40? What will be the value of 7 factorial? 40. 40. The value of the subsequent factorial will be difficult for you. But, now till 7 factorial. If you remember this. where we study and drew a table. Its a little different from the table needed. And once you will again, keep it in your factorials. Remember only, enough to enhance your speed. Otherwise you can always calculate the value of any factorial. What do you want to do? If I talk to you, tell me the value VETA of n factorial. Now you can write it in just once. treatment of nth applies for old outdoor production. So, what is the exception? You should memorize these values just to enhance your speed. Otherwise you can always find these values. 7 factorial is out, you know 6 factorial is 720. So what you have to do is 720 to 720. So you get 5040. Now note the following properties with factorials. Two important things. If you want to write 1 factorial, how will you write it? You know that N plus 1 is the product of 1 to the entire 1. N into N minus 1. I am writing it in the full term. And where will this be? 1 factorial. 1 to the right. Natural numbers are the product of N plus 1. So tell me, if N plus 1 is the same. So what is written? This is N factorial. So there is no property. Common sense. N plus 1 factorial is the same. N plus 1 into N factorial. So remember that. The second thing you have to remember is very important. Remember that N into N factorial is the value of N into N factorial. How can you write this? N plus 1 factorial is minus N factorial. How can you prove this? You have to memorize it. This expression. Because it will come in time. So N minus 1 factorial is the same. Yes, you saw it. N into N plus 1 into N factorial is the same. N factorial is the same. Now you can multiply them and write them. What is the difference? N into N factorial plus N factorial minus N factorial. What is the answer? N plus N into N factorial. So now you can prove it from both sides. It is a little manipulation. So you have to remember it. That N into N factorial is N plus 1 factorial minus N factorial. What do I mean? I am trying to say. How can you write 2 into 2 factorial? N plus 1 is the same. 3 factorial minus 2 factorial. What will the value of 2 factorial be? 2 factorial is 2. 2 into 2 is 4. It is equal to 3 factorial is what? 6 minus 2 is 4. Both are the same. So you have to remember it from both the factorial. Okay. I will talk about a little algebraic expression. For example, binomial expansion. The first or second class we talked about. Okay? It is not that it is not that bad. You have to remember a little about it. Because this identity will be easy. There are some types of questions. When I will show you on screen, then in which you will feel that this is the question. Cat 2000, 2004, yes, binomial has come a little bit. So, binomial expansion. What are all these studies? These are operations. Which you study on numbers. The classification of numbers. I will tell you what are the numbers. And then we are talking about what are the different type of arithmetic operations, other type of operations. Which you can perform on numbers. So, one is the same thing. Binomial expansion. So, what do you do there? I mean, you have a sum. A plus B raised to the power n. What does it mean? A plus B has to multiply the n times. Because we have seen yesterday. What does it mean? When you are multiplying it in one way, how many times? N times. If you multiply A plus B, then what will be the expression? So, it will write a way for binomial. So, what is that way? A plus B. Remember that. How will it be in derivation? This is binomial expansion. If it is in derivation, then we are talking about ITJ. Then we are studying engineering. Sorry, you don't have to do that. You don't have to do technicalities. But we have to remember this formula. We have to memorize this formula. How to produce this formula? I can give you those tips. First of all, there is some expression. You have to say this expression in NCR. Its physical significance is we will study it in a deep modern maths. We will study permutation combinations. This is selecting R distinct objects out of N distinct objects. Remember this formula. And forget it. This is something like NCR. And what is NCR? So, NCR is the mathematical interpretation. The mathematical significance. How do you select R objects out of N distinct objects? How do they do it? How does it be written? It is nothing but N factorial. How will NCR be N factorial? Upon R factorial into N minus R factorial. What happened? You will have to remember this formula. NCR is defined as all these things. Now you will have to study a little bit. But please remember them. Be comfortable. Because I promise you, when I will give you the answer to this formula, what is NCR? What is NCR? The most good thing about the modern maths is that in the world. Don't worry. But remember this expression. That NCR is defined as N factorial upon R factorial into N minus R factorial. How do you write this? In numerator and denominator. What is R factorial directly? And N minus R. Now, let's perform some values. For example, I am telling you 3C2. What is 3C2? What is 3C2? So what will you write? 3 factorial upon R factorial into 2 factorial into 3 minus 2 factorial. So what is 3 factorial? Upon E is 2 factorial. And 3 minus 2 factorial is 1 factorial. Let me solve this. How much will be solved? 3 factorial is 6. 3 into 2 into 1. 2 factorial is 2. 1. So what is 3C2's value? Right? Also, remember one thing about this. NCR is also equal to NCR minus R. Correct? What does that mean? 3C2. What does that mean? It can be this. 3C1. NCR is equal to NCR minus R. That is, you will do 3 minus 2 too. 3C1. Because 3C1's value will be the same. 1 factorial. 3 minus 1 factorial is 2 factorial. And it is nothing but 6 upon 2 which is also equal to 3. We will link this. What will we read? Modern maths. But just believe me. And remember the binomial expansion. How it comes. NCR is understood. Now see. A plus B raised to the power N. How to expand it? So I use this NCR. And where do I use it? This is the power N. I will start from 0. This term is R. I will start from 0. And I will write it in plus. plus NC1 plus NC2 plus NC3 plus NC2 plus NC3 plus NC2. And I will write all the terms. Now I will write A and B in the product. A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B. And what will be in the last? A and B. Now I have to put power on both numbers. Such that the orderly power should be applied. For example, if I put power N on one, then B will be 0. Now A will be less than 1. And B will be 1. So it will become N minus 1. And what will be B? Now see what will be N. What is N? A will be 2. 1 power N minus 3. B power 3. And so on. So in the last, N minus N will be 0. And sorry, A power which becomes 0. And what will be B power? And this is your expression. Okay. Let's understand it again. Bi-nomial means two terms. The sum, high power, it is made like an expand. This is the expression. It uses one this term NCR. NCR significance will talk about it later. But for now, NCR is defined as N factorial upon R factorial into N minus R factorial. I know you will be rotted. Don't worry. Then what do you write? Nc 0, Nc 1, Nc 2, Nc 3, Nc n. Now A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, Multiply. Plus sign. Now you have to use first power N A. And A is applied again 0. N minus 1, 1, N minus 2, 2. Order is going to be created from here. And this is your expression. Now why does it happen? Why do we look at it? What significance is this? First term, this is the value of R is 0. For every subsequent term, R increases by 1. Power of A reduces by 1. And power of B increases by 1. I will tell you what is the last term that you orderly. Power is N, there will be N plus 1 terms. All these things you know, do not need to write. What is the significance of this? You will only know one thing. A plus B is whole square. You have the idea of identity. What happens? A square plus B square plus 2A. This is identity. How can you see it as a binary? Never forget. You don't need to remember. So look at it as a binary expansion. A plus B whole square will be Nc 0 A into B. plus Nc 1 A into B plus Nc 2. And what I am writing is 2. Let's see what I will use here. So it is nothing but 2C 0 2C 1 and 2C 2 A into B. Now look. A power is 2. Then 1 power will be 1. This will be 1 and B power will be 1. This will be 0 and this will be 2. So look at the expression. The value of 2C 0 will be 1. Nc 0 is always 1. 1 into A square into B raise to the power 0. So you get A raise square plus 2C 1. 2 value. I am leaving you in calculation. If you are going home and go home, then you will be able to revise your bed. You will be able to understand the things. When you see it before the next class, you will be able to see it tomorrow. I don't know. Whenever you see it, you have to solve it yourself. I have told you that you feel it. You have to solve it yourself. This is 2C 1. How will you get 2C 1? 2 factorial over 1 factorial into 1 factorial is the value of 2. 2C 1 A B plus 2C 2. What is 2C 2? It has value of 1 into A raise to the power 0 is 1 into B square. So look, that formula is here. Your A square plus B square plus 2A B. Now you can extend it for any power. A minus B whole square. What do you have to do here? You have to replace B by minus B by this formula. What will happen? A square minus 2A B plus B square. Now, keep the same thing here. Now, you can even use some binomial expressions. A B plus B raise to the power n. This is your idea. Okay. Yes. Here is an important thing that was going to happen. Remember, remember that A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. You have expression like this. A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. It will always have a factor A minus 2. A minus B is a factor. Which means it will be equal to A minus B into here. Something. You can do something like this. Okay. It is something. Okay. What is this? A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. This is always the factor A minus B. Remember this. Also, you have to keep the whole expression here. A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. Using binomial, how do you write this? A minus B into A raise to the power n minus 1 into B 0. A raise to the power n minus 2B1 and so on. Okay. So, what will you take away from here? What is the important point that this expression A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. It will always have A minus B as a factor. Or you can say this. This can always be divided by A minus B. Okay. Now, if you see one thing here. Okay. Let's see. Remember this. Or you can tell me. Like this expression. Now, you are thinking of it as n even. What is the significance of an odd? Then it will happen. So, let's make a table in this. Let's talk about A raise to the power. If there is even and minus B raise to the power even. A raise to the power even plus B raise to the power even. A raise to the power odd plus B raise to the power odd. A raise to the power odd minus B raise to the power odd. Right. Now, let's see. That X minus Y. And X plus Y. Who is the factor? What are we talking about? Sorry, A minus B and E plus B. What are we talking about? Hold on, guys. I am talking about, if I am talking about expression. I have told you that A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. I will always be a factor A minus B. But I am extending this power to every power. Same power even. Same power even. But expression will be added. Same power odd. Same power odd. Expressions plus or minus. So, what is A minus B? And A plus B. Is it a factor or not? This is the thing to see. Now, A raise to the power even minus B raise to the power E. If A minus B is a factor. What is the meaning of geometry? If A equal to B, if you keep this expression, it will be zero. So, what is the point of A? Is it zero? Yes. So, what is A plus B? Is it a factor? If this factor is the equation. So, if you place this equal to zero. A plus B equal to zero. If you put this expression in expression, then this expression should be zero. Let's see. B key power even minus B raise to the power even. Always give you B raise to the power E. So, it is also canceling and zero is going to be zero. That is, A power even is equal to minus B power even. So, A minus B is a factor. A plus B is a factor. The smallest example I will tell you is A square minus B square. Identity if you remember. It is nothing but A plus B A minus B. Okay? Let's check it for the same. A is B, is it zero or not? Is it minus B? Is it zero or not? This means A raise to the A square plus B square is not a factor. A raise to the power Z, odd plus B raise to the power odd. I will put B here. If I keep B here, then what will be zero? It will not be. This is not a factor. If I keep B, then it is a power odd. It will always give you minus B. This means that this will be zero. This is a factor. Similarly, for A raise to the power odd, minus B raise to the power odd. What are you talking about? How do you check A minus B factor? How do you check A minus B has equal to zero. That means, put B here. So, B raise to the power odd minus B raise to the power odd. Is it zero or not? When B is put minus B, then this will be minus B raise to the power odd. If B is put minus B raise to the power odd. And B raise to the power odd. This is not a cancel. This will not be a factor. I extended this point more. Please remember this table. It will help you immensely. This is the result of A raise to the power n minus B raise to the power n. If there is an expression, then it will always have A minus B as a factor. You should remember this. Now, this is the table where you should screenshot it. In this video, how to take a photo of it. You should also put this table on your table. These are algebraic formulas, expansions. Where do you get this? If you do not remember, then you will learn the binomial expansion. You will find out all the things. Otherwise, you can mug up these. If you remember, then it will be very good to use them. This is the form of the expansion. There is no need to tell them. Now, we have read the last topic of this topic. Let me give you two examples. Let them do it. It is a little over time. So, please tell me two questions. The remainder is when this expression is divided by 19. All I am asking is, If I divide 15 raised to the power 23 plus 23 raised to the power 23 by 19, what will you get as a remainder? What will be the remainder? You have to tell me this. And I want you to tell all of them. You have to take a little help of the last slide. Now, think about it. What has been told? What is the remainder? What is the remainder? The rest of the power n plus b rest of the power n. Right? اس کا 1 Factor, Hamesha, kya oga? Yes, اس کا A plus B would be a Factor, اس کا A plus B time something bunnyge, yes, equation. اسка, madalav, essa Expression, Hamesha, 38 Factor, oga.

In fact, if you want to check if this is 0 this is 1 so this is 0 so this is 0 so if you solve this, you will solve the answer 9 by 11 so 0 point 8 and this value will be expressed and 0.81 when you multiply 30, what do you get? whatever value will be greater than 1 by 4 correct? what you have approximated here this is the use of binomial but I am saying 1 minus 29 this is less than 1 this is 65 so it is 1 by 1 you are minusing the numerator is 1 plus 29 by 30 this is 64 so this is 1 by 2 and it is a big denominator so you can assume 1 is a big 11 1.1 you can see 0.8 in fact I have taken a very big numerator but slightly less than 1 so this point 8 and you will approximate this is a very big expression and you are multiplying 30 if you multiply 30 then anyway it is a value is way more than 1 this is greater than 1 and then what you were saying I confused how is greater than 1 it is a denominator 0.8 is greater than 1 it is a point 8 is the expression now you have to multiply 30 so that will be a greater than 1 yes 0.8 it is a point 8 so I don't understand no it is a point 8 is greater than 1 yes now I will relax a little and I will relax now this is expression cat is all about common sense think this is a very big expression why we have seen it how I am saying it is 2 power 2 circle circle circle circle circle circle ok That's it say 9 4KASPASARAI Lugber Lugber .4 RCOMMENT 3RASTODI POWER 3RASTODI POWER 3RASTODI POWER 3KITNAYA 27-8 Upon 27-8 ISMISI-KARA 8-19AGA 35 ASKOGAGA 0.5 Stepping's work 10でした 13-2 10-2 THAT is the root I have decided all things to get fully charged
